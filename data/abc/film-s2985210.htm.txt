<h2>Tomorrow When The War Began</h2>
<p class="ratd"> Rated <em>M</em></p>
<p><em>Review by Margaret Pomeranz</em></p>
<p>The series of young adult novels by John Marsden that started with TOMORROW WHEN THE WAR BEGAN are one of the most popular and celebrated in this country. The adaptation of the first in the series is just about to come to our cinemas, from screenwriter Stuart Beattie who also made it his debut as director. It's about a group of young people who are away camping in a remote location when Australia is invaded by a foreign power. They are Ellie - CAITLIN STASEY and her best friend Corrie - RACHEL HURD-WOOD, Corrie's boyfriend Kevin - LINCOLN LEWIS, Ellie's neighbour and friend from her youth, the tearaway Homer - DENIZ AKDENIZ, the beautiful rich girl Fiona - PHOEBE TONKIN, a boy that Ellie finds interesting Lee - CHRIS PANG and the religious and practical Robyn- ASHLEIGH CUMMINGS. It's hard for these young people to realise what's happened to the world that they left such a short time ago...<br/><br/>Ellie is the narrator of the story, and ostensibly the leader. They are an intrepid group and they're not content to hide away without trying to take on the enemy...<br/><br/>All the actors come from experience in Australian television series except for CHRIS PANG, this is his first role and of course the British actress RACHEL HURD-WOOD. Mostly they do a fine job, but the standouts for me were DENIZ AKDENIZ, ASHLEIGH CUMMINGS and CAITLIN STASEY who actually has to convey much of the mood of the book, expressing as it does her doubts and confusion about her feelings. You can understand the appeal of the book to young adults, because it shows the resourcefulness and humanity of the young in the face of something terrible. Stuart Beattie handles the action well, I think he's less adept at handling the development of character, but I'm sure the numerous fans of the book will be satisfied with the movie.</p>
<h2>Further comments</h2>
<p>MARGARET: David?<br/><br/>DAVID: I know you've read the book. I haven't read the book. The theme is very, very similar to John Milius's film RED DAWN made, I think, in 1984 from memory, which is about a Russian invasion of America and how young people take to the hills and become guerrilla warriors against the invaders. So it was a bit of a deja vu situation for me. Now, Stuart Beattie has written some extraordinary screenplays. The first PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, COLLATERAL...<br/><br/>MARGARET: COLLATERAL.<br/><br/>DAVID: ...are among his CV and, as you say, this is the first film he's directed and I think he does a very competent job. It's a very slick film but I couldn't believe this group of friends. , they're supposed to be sufficiently friendly to be able to go off on this trip together and they just didn't seem to go together and some of them behaved in very odd ways, like the blonde who doesn't think she's beautiful when she clearly is. , what's that all about? I didn't understand that at all.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Oh, David. <br/><br/>DAVID: What?<br/><br/>MARGARET: Well, I think, people's image of self is often at odds with the reality.<br/><br/>DAVID: Well, that may be but so don't cast such an obviously beautiful actress to play the part. Maybe it's the casting that seemed a little bit off at times.<br/><br/>MARGARET: I do think...<br/><br/>DAVID: There was something off about it.<br/><br/>MARGARET: I actually think that for a first time director to take on a cast with such limited experience of film was really...<br/><br/>DAVID: Was bold.<br/><br/>MARGARET: ...was bold and a bit risky.<br/><br/>DAVID: Yes. Yes.<br/><br/>MARGARET: And it doesn't always pay off, I think.<br/><br/>DAVID: No. Yes. There's a slight clunkiness to some of it. It's very slick and I'm sure a lot of people will enjoy it but there was something, as I say, slightly off key that I can't quite put my finger on. <br/><br/>MARGARET: I'm giving it three and a half stars.<br/><br/>DAVID: Me too, three and a half stars.</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[2]]<br>One star for the 2 or 3 comic moments that actually made me laugh. Unfortunately for the actors the script was so bad it made them look bad as well. For a bunch of teenagers suddenly thrown into primal survival mode, the script and directing too often showed them as incredibly stupid.<br><br>David, the pretty girl who thought she wasn't pretty was about maternal competition. If you watch the scene again where she confides in Ellie, you'll see she indicates her mother puts her down and makes her feel unattractive. The theme isn't followed through and so she seems silly.</br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[9]]<br>What edith said is true and well said. It was an incredible movie that shows the power of teamwork and friendship at its absolute best. The moral talk Ellie gives is incredibly thought-provoking. What David and Margaret said, however, is also true, though I think they were being a bit harsh. Fi clearly placed other things above personal beauty, as opposed to her mother, who she compared herself to, a fact that David and Magaret clearly ignored. Friends of different backgrounds make a difference. The comedy was excellent. This movie makes me proud to be an Australian. Great job, Beattie!</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[7]]<br>Could have been a much better movie had they tweaked the script  in a dozen or so places too make it more believable like silly freak outs or not sticking to the shadows but worst of all riding around the country side without a care. Would have been much better if they knew where the road blocks were and how to avoid them. kids can be really sneaky and cunning when the stakes are high ie. skipping school and being unseen, remember how that works</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[8]]<br>I think the best thing about this movie is the acting. People who say the acting was bad obviously don't know a thing about the characters. I just think it was too short which is why I'm only giving it 4 stars. The action scenes and scenery are very good. A few corny moments and it's a little unrealistic at times (people miraculously dodging a hundred bullets etc) but still a good movie</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[5]]<br>I can tell you what was "off" about the film "Tomorrow When the War Began":  the book was about teenagers fighting for freedom and control of their lives. The film cast overly attractive and mature actors who might titillate the adult gaze, but took away the agency and engagement of younger viewers for whom the story was presumably intended.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[1]]<br>I think some peoples comments that this movie was a let down for Australian film is incorrect. TWTWB is an embarrassment to all film and should be banned! Apart from the poor acting, shockingly bad special effects and constantly unrealistic character reactions, the plot itself actually has potential.<br>To think this garbage could be held in any similar regard to actual credit worthy Australian films like Animal Kingdom, Little Fish and The Hard Word is a joke.<br>Margaret and David must have been smoking some of the stuff the 'Chris' character was on to come up with 3.5 stars. <br/></br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[8]]<br>I grew up reading the series by John Marsden and although interested, I was a bit sceptical about the movie.<br><br> I got a very pleasant surprise! I thought the movie stayed true to the book but managed some really great action scenes, despite its being originally slightly more of a teenage drama in the books. Australian attempt at a real blockbuster, it was WAY BETTER than I expected!! <br><br>I give it 4 stars! One star off for a couple of corny moments.<br><br>I can't wait for the next movie!

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[3]]<br>I'm sorry but this was really lacking. It was like Home and Away with guns. We need to honestly appraise it and not give it extra stars just because it's Australian.  Action sequences were well directed. Acting was fine. Script ordinary. I know it's the first in a series but it just seemed so.....brief.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[2]]<br>So bad. So very bad. It's no surprise that all the cocaine in Australia is used by the film and TV industry. There can be no other reason a giant pile of dog doo like this gets off the ground. Another movie that sets back the Film industry 10 years because no one except the DOP should ever work in this industry again. Still, it's better than Black Swan..</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[9]]<br>I think the book was great but the movie was a bit of a disappointment. Could of at least gone for 2 hours! But still good acting and finely a Australian movie that isn't s**t for once. I have chosen to give it 4 1/2 stars because I enjoyed it and can't wait for sequel/s! :D (sorry for the language!)</br></p>

It was an awesom movie but it was too short they needed to make it longer they made it too short but that is the only problem. Cudose to you stuart.</br></p>

Acting was barely average, especially from the lead.<br/>I did like the music, scenary and locations.<br/>I also like the general idea of the plot but it hasn't been done well by either the author (Marsden) or the Director in this instance.<br/>Overall disappointing except for the locations and music.</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[6]]<br/>It was an OK film, but I'm looking forwward to Chris Hemsworth in the Red Dawn remake. David and Margaret say it is risky to put cast with little exerpience in front of the camera. How else do they get the experience then? TWTWB2 should be better, with the cast now more experienced and rumours of Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Steve Innes (as Major Harvey) set to bolster the improving cast. A bit of star, and rising star power, might lift this above the mediocre.</p>

Great special affects with beautiful landscape shots and cinematography. characters a real and relatable with just the right blend of humour and action, this film has the whole package. casey is fantastic as Elle and met the criteria met in my mind for the character in the book. highly anticipating a sequel!</p>

Good acting all round, solid story if a bit predictable, OK special effects.  The movie kept moving, but what I most liked about it was that the director took the time to introduce each of the characters.</p>

Bad writing and directing I guess for what was actually an interesting premise. <br/><br/>Characters were terrible, annoying PC cliches - the Jock is the coward (oh puh-leeze!), And they are not even like normal kids, just incredibly stupid, seriously,  no kids are that dumb - anywhere!<br/><br/>I checked and this guy wrote "GI Joe" one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I just hope they don't let him ruin the rest of it. The writer/director is just childish and politically correct and cliche. Painful.</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[4]]<br/>Hard to take a book so allegorical and match it with modern day 'reality' without the whole thing seeming stumpy (group together seemed utterly implausible; Hell irony pushed too far - ridiculously beautiful). Some dialogue so clunky and implausible (Asian guy articulating the meaning of his restaurant) and many opportunities to explore character left at the two dimensional level (beautiful girl thinks she's ugly, religious girl). I cringed most of the way through and, as an English teacher, would BEG students to stay with the book. Looking For Alibrandi is an example of a far better book to film translation.</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[10]]<br/>OMG.... I think some people just dont know a good movie when they see one. I cannot count how many times I have seen it now and I think to put down the job that was done with this movie is gross negligence. There was a lot of character development through out the movie  and some reviews same the characters acting "odd" either dont know Australians or have never lived outback. I felt that this movie is a great expression of the book.</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[9]]<br/>Quite good really.<br/><br/>Excellent performances from all the young cast, particularly Caitlin Stasey and Rachel Hurd Wood.<br/><br/>Excellent plot line, although it wasn't invented for the movie, so they can't really take credit. A good adaptation of the book though, i've read it.<br/><br/>Wonderful special effects, action and very engaging emotional scenes too.<br/><br/>No racism toward's the invader's. They had to be someone, and it would have been difficult to portray them as "raceless." There were some touching scenes with the enemy too. Showing that there wasn't black and white characterisation.<br/><br/>I really liked it.</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[6]]<br/>I've seen worse.<br/>The letdowns to me were the jarring character development and Hollywood physics.<br/><br/>Firstly, from country girl to natural born killer in a matter of minutes. It seemed far too sudden a shift. Development of character was radically accelerated, likely due to being based on a book where development can span a longer time.<br/><br/>The physics were, to be blunt, ridiculous. A lawnmower explosion, a self igniting quad bike and a 16 year old girl skillfully wielding an AK47 on full auto were a bit much for me to accept.<br/><br/>Enjoyed, but not enough to consider it a good Marsden adaption.</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[9]]<br/>I was very impressed with this adaptation. I have read five out of 7 of the novels (and am going to finish it). The lead actress Caitlan Stasey delivers a great performance who manages to pull the film together emotionally. The rest of the cast were decent as well. The action scenes were slick and well done.<br/><br/>Even though they made the invaders asian, the film did not portray any bit of racism towards them so I am glad they maintained that integrity the novel did. Finally, an Australian film that has blockbuster appeal and can appeal to many people.</p>

Most of our films are soppy peices of &amp;%$# but this was fast paced and exciting. Acting wasn't that bad. Ellie was brilliant, as well as homer and robyn. Chris was hilarious! couldn't stop laughing and Corrie was very good as well. Those five were the very believable ones. Fi was good, but a little overacted. Same with Kevin.

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[5]]<br/>Not bad but not great. Film was too short and felt a little rushed at times. There should have been more time at the front end on character development. The books and therefore movie are set in rural Australia but the characters, particularily the girls, did not speak like the farm girls and boys I know. Came across as very well spoken city kids. Acting was clunky at times with a few Summer Bay and Ramsey st moments. Thought Ellie and Homer were OK. Soundtrack was not right at all. Asian army would be larger and wouldnt have female soldiers</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[8]]<br/>I've read the books and absolutely loved them and am in the middle of the Ellie Chronicles, which are about Ellie's life after the war. <br/>I think David and Margaret were a bit harsh, and some of the other comments, as they portatrayed the characters brilliantly. The parts with the petrol tanker and lawnmower were parts of the book, so they had to be included, and the movie just didn't have enough time to add in the endless amount of planning in the book.<br/>MAYBE YOU SHOULD READ THE BOOK BEFORE JUDGING.</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[5]]<br/>I think that this film was pretty ordinary.  The acting was generally awkward and uncomfortable, not including the leads which were quite good.  Some scenes were pretty cliche and the story was fairly predictable, even for those who haven't read the book.  The scenes didn't flow well enough either.  <br/>But, there are some exciting scenes with pleasing explosions and fast chases.<br/>Adequate film.</p>

Awful film! <br/>I normally adjust Margaret and David's ratings of Australian films down by half to one star but three 3 1/2 is ridiculous. <br/>I have never posted a comment on here before but then I have never been in such complete disagreement with a film review.<br/>I didn't believe a single character.</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[2]]<br/>This film was destined to be a disaster with such a terrible screenplay. Suprising from an experienced writer in Beattie. Such a shame as I hear only good things about Marsden's novel. <br/>Some of the dialogue was just terrible and the attempts at humour were cringe worthy at best.<br/>Beattie, obviously no Director, even helped seasoned pro Colin Friels'  to produce the worst performance of his career. Extraordinary! <br/>The one star I did give is for the cinematography and the group of young actors who actually made Beattie's awful writing and direction into something in between bad and really average.<br/></p>

This was one of those rare film where at the end I said Thank God ... and yet I'm an atheist. The moment when one of the girls is reading My brillant career and gets asked is it any good and she said "The book is better than the movie" should've been a clue, I know you guys are a little sided towards Australian films but c'mon not every film from Australia is a 3 star or better</p>

Streaming video.<br/>Characters talk about only going out at night <br/>cause it is dangerous.<br/> The next day they are out in the day with no thought.<br/>A character almost kills someone for falling asleep. Shortly after she is talking socially as enemy approach her before another vital scene.<br/>One character is made out to be a coward then his whole personality changes to be a hero later in movie?<br/><br/>Add the above with TV acting.<br/>Australian acting, American acting, whatever.

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[6]]<br/>I love the book  - which I think made it harder to love the movie. Not all bad but not great, agree there was something slightly off key - maybe just the difficulty of adapting book to screen especially Marsden's brilliant detail and character development. Thought the characters in the movie were too much like caricatures. Some of the acting and dialogue not great, though overall Caitlin Stasey did well with Ellie. The drama between/within characters and theme exploration needed more depth; the action was ok. Hated the (group) hero shot at the end, loved the book vs film reference.</p>

I liked how you could actually relate to the characters becuase they had a mix of character driven stuff and action scenes.

Hollywood films are individual, they can be picked out from a group of films, so can Bollywood films, so why not make an up and coming industry individual and unique? I And whether or not Australia has cracked that style or not doesn't matter, because practises makes perfect, so don't worry, I can assure you perfection is coming.</p>

There was however something off, as David said, and I believe this to be the over exaggerated acting, for example Lincon Lewis, during his featured moments seemed extemely over the top, and unbelievable. It seemed when they tried they didn't succeed in capturing the interest of the audience.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[7]]<br/>Just saw this, it was a fantastic adaptation, but I guess if I wasn't already a huge fan of the material, I'd have been less impressed.  Can I just say about David: Almost every single beautiful girl I know has some level of self-image issue, the most beautiful being the worst.  So I guess he hasn't spent much time with teenage girls lately.</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[8]]<br/>It was very well made and I really enjoyed it. What David said about Fiona believing she wasn't beautiful when she clearly is, that outlines how many teenage girls feel about themselves and I think it was reasonable. Not all of the characters were entirely close to each other, they were mainly Ellie's friends so maybe that's why you didn't get the feel that they were a close friendship group. It felt intense throughout the entire movie and suspenful. I'm a fan of the books. The acting was good. It was captiavating and emotional. He grasped the main themes well.</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[7]]<br/>I really enjoyed this film. All of the actors were surprisingly good - the actresses who played Robyn and Corrie really stood out for me. <br/><br/>I think David missed the point a bit - the group aren't intended to be a "tight-knit group" in the beginning. Ellie is the only one who has a connection to everyone, and the others (bar Fi) vaguely know each-other through school.<br/><br/>My advice to ppl yet to see it is not to expect too much - it's a good movie, but if you expect it to be as good as the books, you'll be disappointed.</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[7]]<br/>I have read all the books about 10 years ago, overall i thought it was a very good adaption.  Even though I knew what was going to happen it was very exciting and involving from start to finish.<br/><br/>The only thing i found wanting was the accents.  They were way too "city" for the country setting, to the point where Fi's accent had to be absudly posh to differentiate.  I have never heard an Australian teenager speak like that (and I live on Sydney's north shore!).  That made it all feel a bit false for me.</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[6]]<br/>For an Australian action film, it did do quite well. Some of the editing was unbelievable, and it did feel like a giant advertisement at times, but it ticked most boxes. I know the characters were older, so I feel that the actions from the foreign military should have been more...realistic? I mean, they show a man getting shot point-blank, but then at other times they seemed sort of silly in reaction to the children. I was discomforted with the character development, as the acting seemed to get worse. All in all though, a very sellable film from Australia.</p>

But this movie is so close to the book, while sometimes this isnt the case with most book to movies.  Because it was so close to the book i think it made me enjoy it all the more despite some scenes.  Its like a visual version of the book which i can watch with out the hasle of turning pages. i want to see it as many times as i can.</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[8]]<br/>My hubby and I are over 50, so were others in our audience and we were all thoroughly entertained by this film.<br/>Going into without reading the books, only hype, I expected a good story aimed at teenagers.  I was blown away by a fantastic action film with page-turning pace and quality effects.  The production values couldn't be faulted although yes, I had a few, brief questioning moments which were soon erased by my involvemnt with the characters.  A clever adaptation, a true action move and ensemble piece, perfectly aimed at it's teenage audience which we thoroughly enjoyed. Thanks Stuart!</p>

Read the books years ago and only vaguely remember them so didn't have that problem of not finding it a faithful enough adaptation.<br/><br/>A great action flick that had me on the absolute edge of my seat the whole time.<br/><br/>Agree some of the casting is a bit off - Fiona can't really be that jaw droppingly beautiful. In many ways Rachael Hurd-Wood looks more the part of Fi - very pretty but not quite so perfect and 'doll like' as Pheobe Tonkin. and some clunky acting and very weird accents going on.</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[8]]<br/>I'm 54, and I have read the books several times, and was really looking forward to the movie.<br/>The movie wasn't perfect, but I really enjoyed it, and am going again soon. There were several moments in the movie which gave me goose bumps, and I'm hoping that there will be at least 2 sequels.<br/>The action sequences were top rate, and it had the look of a block-buster.<br/>The main problems came from trying to condense the book into less than 2 hours, but they did well. Didn't like what hey did to the character of Robyn, though.</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[8]]<br/>I agree that some of the acting wasn't great - there was something amiss that I can't quite identify. But, the plot was great. As 25yo's who grew up reading the books (more than once), my fiance and I loved seeing the story on screen.<br/><br/>As has been said a number of times already, most of the negative plot comments refer to the story as it was written. And, I would rather the movie stays true to the book, than made 'more realistic' while loosing the connection to the original.<br/><br/>Can't wait for the rest of the series!</p>

The acting was below average, the plot thin, and the credibility almost non-existent. That said, the special FX guys deserve some credit for so good scenes, however unlikely the scenes might have been. Oh well, next time I'll read another review before going to a M&amp;D 3.5 star  rated movie.</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[4]]<br/>Definitely an older childrens movie and may be for teens up to 15yrs. The awkward and poorly developed love scenes should have been left on the shelf..it just brought Summer Bay to the Big Screen. Poorly scripted and acted the exception being the 'pot smokin' ,hey dude character. There were a couple of highlights - the missile attack on the Australian fighter plane, the car chase where a modified dune buggy becomes entangled in a fallen overhead wire and lastly the bridge explosion. Apart from that totally unconvincing and unbelieavable. Wait fotr the dvd</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[8]]<br/>I have read all the books in the series (more than once I'll confess) so I was keen to see the movie, I actually felt it was an excellent reproduction of the fist book, the money was obviously spent on effects etc and not necessarily on characters / actors, but I believe this could develop with the movies to follow, The characters in the book are all flawed and dealing with pressures of teenage hood while under extreme situations. Above all I gave it the international embarrassment test, I think its good enough to show on the world stage.</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[7]]<br/>The adaption was outstanding, considering the amount of content in the book. The casting for me was a little inaccurate - Chris was looked too old for his character. Many of Ellie's lines in the book were given to Kevin too, which was odd. Also they should have put more effort into the evolution of the relationships between characters - especially Fi and Homer. For me, it wasn't intense enough. They left many crucial scenes out. For an Australian movie it lived up to expectations and despite the many criticsms I have, I applaud the impressive action and explosion scenes.</p>

They do notbelievethey are pretty. The character in the book is basicaly described as very pretty so ofcourse they needed a beautiful actor. Also, i would have given it 4 stars, bein a meda studen, i know all the techniques and jargen but it was also exceptionally good, for an australian film.

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[8]]<br/>I had never heard of 'Red Dawn' until I read these reviews and decided to watch it then do a comparison.  Can some-one please tell me what is so great about Red Dawn? It's cliched, poorly scripted and acted.  Where-as TWTWB is an excellent adaptation of the excellent John Marsden books.  Well scripted, well acted and mercifully free of the hokey Cold War boogey-man cliches in Red Dawn. Sorry RD = 2 (VERY generous stars)  TWTWB - 4 stars and bring on the sequel... (Couldn't find a sequel for Red Dawn - I guess Hollywood doesn't encourage clunkers)</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[8]]<br/>A fantastic adaptation of the book. I think they have done a wonderful production and a brilliant book series. Yes some of the characters needed a bit more thought, but some were excellent (Homer, Robyn) and how can you have a Aussie movie without an appearance by Colin Friels? This 41 year old LOVED it, taking my kids again next weekend and I hope word spreads on the movie so that the next two movies will be made.</p>

When you've seen as many movies as I have you'll be able to judge.  I was challenged by the content of this story - haven't read the books - my kids have.  Every Australian should see this movie - every young person should see this movie.  We have gone soft here in Aussie., we take our freedom for granted.  More should have been included about how they got themselves organised, which is in the book.</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[2]]<br/>I wished I had something else to do for the duration of this film. I couldn't help myself but repeatedly groan and throw my head against the back of my seat during the screening of this film - weak dialogue, lacklustre plot and vast examples of very poor acting. I know it's important that we watch and enjoy Australian films (because who else will?) but I don't understand why there are so many Australian films that don't hit the mark. Sadly, this movie goes my pile with such 'masterpieces' as 'Bad Bush'. And stereotyped 'bad Asians'? Pur-lease!</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[6]]<br/>As a teenage coming of age story it works better then an action movie. The action sequences work fine, in fact very good but not all plot points hold up under scrutiny.  The invading army seemed so ruthless and efficient on occasions and yet hopeless on others. The most obvious problem is that there so little mentioned about family and friends - a glaring omission. But I want this series to succeed and continue. The Australian film industry needs it to.</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[6]]<br/>They are both right in saying that there was definitely something quite off about this film. Before the movie really got going into its more action filled phase I found it hard to believe in the character. Partly it was the acting and partly it was the script and partly it was the casting; for some of the characters anyway. The subtle humor and brilliant action sequences seemed to make up for this though. Overall I enjoy this a lot.</p>

The script had no rhythm or consistency.<br/><br/>Ashleigh Cummings was the only potential stand out. But with that script it would have been hard for any actor to bring any sense of depth or substance to their character.<br/><br/>It scares me that this could be a series.</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[7]]<br/>I've never read these books, but am tempted to go back and have a look.  This was a solidly enjoyable film.  The photography was great and it was good to see some realistic characters in an Australian film for a change.  (This reminded me SO much of my teenage years)  There were several moments of real tension, and a lot of humour<br/><br/>However it was let down by some clunky dialogue and a complete disregard for the laws of physics in the action scenes. (Impossible explosions and bullet-proof vehicles).<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing to support Australian cinema.</p>

It is time critics stopped glossing over how bad Aussie movies are and say what they really think.  Aussies try to make artistic not commercial flicks and that's why they fail.  Screen Australia should only fund and produce movies that follow the Hollywood structure.</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[8]]<br/>I was madly in love with the books as a kid (much more than Harry Potter which also captivated my generation). I had high expectations of this film, particularly of the character of Ellie, who was a bit of a heroine of mine. Pleased to say that Caitlin Stasey nailed the role, as did Deniz Akdeniz. The other actrors were good but just a touch wooden at points. Interestingly, the most experienced actor - Lincoln Lewis, I found the most disappointing. Also liked the little self-referential joke in the middle about the old books vs movies debate.</p>

Saturday night crowd really enjoyed it, especially stoner Chris.<br/>Seemed a bit bitsy to me. Not enough good narrative explanation flowing through the film, so you don't notice the hiccups. Crudfe ending though showing disdain for audience. You don't need a sequel to find out what happens. Wrap up this story and then get on with the next one.</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[7]]<br/>I took my children to see this movie as we enoyed the books.  True, there are some  plot holes, but they are plot holes from the book, so not much could be done about them.  The dialogue is odd sometimes and the casting was a bit off.  Caitlin Stacey, though a fine actor, did "fit" Ellie to me.  She was too pretty, too made up and not muscular enough.  And what was with the eyeliner?  That just seemed wrong.<br/>In general though, we really enjoyed the film.  It doesn't pretend to be realistic - it's just a great story.</p>

Forget the follies of the enemy, the coalition.. these kids were incredibly stupid! Let's just stop, and stand there shall we after we've just set a fuel tanker alight! Let's pause now they have lights on me and wait till they start shooting! Let's suggest making as much noise as we can with a garbage truck instead of being discreet - how idiotic you have 8 teens and no weapons you have to be as discreet as possible! Horrile.</p>

Never seen a movie that had me laughing out loud so often, but also so scared for the characters that I was crying at some points. The first gun-fire scene could have been in the place I grew up in, or any number of small towns I've been to. My dad drives that type of fire truck, for goodness sake. It was all so real. <br/><br/>I thought the pace was fantastic, the acting good, the design incredible, the cinematography great. Really, one of the best films I've seen. Very affecting, very entertaining. Bring on part 2!!!!!</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[8]]<br/>To David; obviously he doesn't understand teenage girls with a comment like that, but that's okay, not many people do. <br/><br/>And that's what made this movie great, they looked and acted like teenagers, even when everything went to hell. Comparing it to RED DAWN, isn't doing it justice. This is the Australian perspective, stories always get worked and reworked, but for once it's about us, and not them.<br/><br/>My greatest hope is that it is allowed to be finished with books 2 and 3, because the friendships and character development really takes off then. This was only a taste.</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[8]]<br/>It was great! i think the film should have been longer, and included important character building aspects of the film. Such as Ellie and Corrie breaking down and becoming inconsolable. These was major aspects of depth in the book. Or including aspects of setting up the camp, the journey into Hell. The moments of introspection were not as succinct as the moments of action. The action however, was beleivable for the most part. Which was absolutely vital! A good job indeed! some scenes were exactly as i'd imagined. I was very pleased with it. <br/><br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[6]]<br/>Arguably, The most highly anticipated Aussie blockbuter since 'Australia', TWTWB has a hell of a lot more pressure on it due to the sensational 'tomorrow series' by JM. <br/>I am not a book reader, unfortunately! However!! Nothing has taken me on a more emotionally charged journey than Ellie and the Gang when I read the series 10 years ago. And sadly, The film didn't take me on that same journey. This is such a unique story, but the film didn't feel unique. I have a much more in depth view of TWTWB on facebook - Feel free to read!</p>

I know that alot of money was spent and it paid off.<br/>i think the cast werent great. They didnt seem to fit. Its like they began filming and the actors hadnt warmed to eachother and this was somewhat conveyed in the film. By 20minutes in, the relationships and acting got better. There were a few moments that could have been left out. Overall a good film, i predict franchise oppurtunities</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[9]]<br/>Best Aaustralian film I've seen in years, a good old rollercoaster ride of a film. The final shot was a bit over the top but the rest of the film hit all the right notes for an action film. Yes there is the inevitable Red Dawn comparisons but that was so long ago and this was set in our own backyard.<br/><br/>Awesome!</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[0]]<br/>I was told that David and Margaret are "generous" toward Aussie made movies and in this case they were.......incredibly generous. <br/>The plot, the acting, the directing, the music- except for The Temper Trap- were all so so so bad. Even if you are curious, don't go and see this movie.  If you do, take a book or your iPhone.</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[10]]<br/>A great adaptation of a brilliant book and perfect casting. Gee it was good to sit and watch an Australian film based on an Australian book. If David could get his head into the book and read it instead of comparing it to a smalzy, B grade piece of American trash like Red dawn THEN he can write a decent review. I am 54, I've read the books, twice, watched it today with my daughter and could watch it again tomorrow.<br/>Bring on the sequels!</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[7]]<br/>I agree with both of them, This film has some really great action moments in the film, as soon as the first gunshot goes off you could really feel the adrenaline pick up in the theatre, The Explosions in this film are done well too, I especially loved how there was debris that literally misses the characters by inches, they're so well done.<br/><br/>I did feel that the characters were a little stereotyped especially in the way the characters of Homer, Li, Fiona, Robin and Chris were introduced, as well as the corny dialogue.</p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[10]]<br/>This is the BEST Aussie movie in a long time, and could be Australias answer to the Twilight/Dragon Tattoo franchises. <br/><br/>Writer/Director Stuart Beattie said in a recent Movie Convention in Qld, they have only done the first film from the first book (John Marsdens - Tomorrow books - 8 in all) to see how it goes<br/><br/>It was filmed on our doorstep Blue Mts/Hunter Valley and Fox studios.<br/><br/> Aimed at the teen fans, its a film for all ages, especially those who grew up with the 'Tomorrow Books'.<br/><br/>IMO - bring it on!!<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Tomorrow When The War Began))[[7]]<br/>The extra half a star is..."It is Australian". The film work is good well paced with only a few kills; seemingly too much emotional character responses. Characters lingering in possible imminent danger frustrates me personal too. Is it just me? <br/><br/>I think Stuart has done a good job and I don't want to "sting" him too much. If there were less screen time spent on squeezing in 7 character developments it would have been less disruptive to the flow. I'm being very picky... I liked what the stoner character brought in to the film. Well done anyway... Go see.</p>
