<h2>The King's Speech</h2>
<p class="ratd"> Rated <em>M</em></p>
<p><em>Review by Margaret Pomeranz</em></p>
<p>Most of us are familiar with the story of how our present Queen's father was forced to take on the throne when her uncle Edward VIII - played in the film - and deliciously played I might add - by GUY PEARCE - decided to opt for life with American divorcee Mrs Wallace Simpson rather than staying on as King. <br/><br/>What is less known is that Bertie - that's what the new King's intimates called him - had a speech impediment which made public speaking of any sort an agonizing embarrassment. He had tried various cures, all of them failed, until his wife Elizabeth, later the Queen, played by HELENA BONHAM CARTER, dragged him to see an Australian elocutionist Lionel Logue - played by GEOFFREY RUSH... and that's when the fun and games begin... between the down-to-earth Australian and the man before whom the world bowed.</p>
<h2>Further comments</h2>
<p>MARGARET: It's so delightful, didn't you think, David?<br/><br/>DAVID: Yes. Look, this is a real actor's piece and Geoffrey Rush, who was one of the executive producers, and Colin Firth are really superb in these roles; Helena Bonham Carter too. I thought maybe some of the supporting actors, like Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill and Derek Jacobi as the Archbishop of Canterbury, maybe slightly overdid it. They sort of tipped into caricature a little bit. <br/><br/>MARGARET: That didn't worry me. I thought Helena Bonham Carter was actually superb as Elizabeth.<br/><br/>DAVID: She's terrific, yes. It's one of her best parts, I think.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Yes. The thing that got me and you see it a bit in that clip, is that the design of that room where all these exercises take place, it looks like a ruined bomb shelter on one wall.<br/><br/>DAVID: Very strange.<br/><br/>MARGARET: And you think, what is that all about?<br/><br/>DAVID: It's not explained.<br/><br/>MARGARET: It distracts from what's going on.<br/><br/>DAVID: Yes.<br/><br/>MARGARET: But, the heart of this film is the relationship between Bertie and Lionel and it works superbly because of those performances.<br/><br/>DAVID: Because the performances are so good, yes.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Yes.<br/><br/>DAVID: I'm giving it four out of five.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Me too, four out of five.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[9]]<br>Having foxtel I always watch movies multiple times if I like them. I've watched this movie more than once. In a nutshell it has a very interesting story, but more compelling is the high octane acting. Honestly, the one thought whilst watching this film was that this is great actors all doing what they do best.  Nice one!</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[9]]<br>This is an absolute ripper of a movie.  Firth played the role superbly, and so convincingly that I almost stopped breathing while he was making his speeches.  Settings were superb, and just the right amount of Aussieness about Rush to make him believable for the time period.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[8]]<br>Beautifully shot, superb performances and an oscar worthy win by Colin Firth. I don't think this deserved best picture in comparison with the Social Network, and while I enjoyed this film and loved the characters, it didn't draw me in as much as I would have liked. However, a very well made, wonderfully told film about the King's speech and how Lionel stood by him all the way.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[10]]<br>One of the best movies I've seen - a previously unknown but true story beautifully brought to life by a great script and superb performances.  Being from the UK the abdication was something my mother &amp; grandmother  occassionally mentioned while Edward was alive and were very harsh on his relationship with Wallace. But he was afterall a playboy at heart!   It was also a great source of humour in the film to see how stuffy life was in the Royal family not that long ago. (Perhaps still?)</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[9]]<br>Have to say something about Jennifer Ehle.  I always felt (as confirmed by researching Emily Procter (CSI:Miamai)) that the North Carolinan (and I believe Texan) accent is very 'flat ' -  like Australian. So not surprised to find that Ehle is from North Carolina.  But with a so-called British-Australian Co-production, and a relatively small part for Jennifer, I wonder why this part did not go to an Australian? But Ehle is very 'laconic' and very 'Australian' in the part - she did a good job.</br></p>

What more would anyone want, but for some reason I left the theatre not completely (5 star) satisfied. After so much hype I expected more. I agree with M &amp; D's 4 star rating.

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[9]]<br>This is a great film about Monarchy in a Democracy, especially at War.  There's a line where Bertie acknowledges that he has no power, but carries the expectations of the public.  As to Guy Pearce I thought he was great. No-doubt the casting director had many from whom to chose - he did the role well.  HBC must have studied the young QueenMother - for mine she had her mannerisms and body-language 'down pat'.  Firth is good because he shows the strong Prince and King obscured by the imperfections. But I doubt his is an Oscar winning performance. Rush's is.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[6]]<br>Yes, a beautiful movie, yes, a beautiful Colin Firth, yes, nice to see Helen Bonham Carter being so elegantly and cheekily normal for once, but honestly, this is the last time I go to see a film AFTER hearing so much hype.  The audience was so pumped up expecting this brilliant film, that they were tittering at the slightest thing before it even happened.  However, Colin Firth did such a SPLENDID job of being both humanly humble and broad-shouldered magnificent, that Im giving it another star.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[10]]<br>I took my soon-to-be 11-year-old daughter to see this movie (despite the M-rating) for a number of reasons.  I wanted her to understand that speech impediments can affect anybody, even those born into privileged circumstances, and this in turn can make public-speaking a torturous exercise; also courage and dogged persistence can overcome adversity even when the odds are stacked against you.  My daughter was the only child in the cinema that night which was a little uncomfortable for her at the start but once the movie started she was totally immersed in the story line and great performances.  Truly inspirational!</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[8]]<br>Colin Firth's best performance ever - he completely immersed himself into the role.  I wasn't convinced that "Bertie" would have yelled that loud though!  Surely someone so severely repressed would have had difficulty expressing rage so openly.  Still, both men richly deserve their Award nominations.  And I love everything Timonthy Spall does.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[9]]<br>A beautiful film overall. It was obvious the film was focusing on a single issue, which was the king's speech impediment and his relationship with close others. This was perhaps its strength and weakness. A strength in terms of the originality of the concept, but probably a weakness too, in that the war seemed merely an insignificant backdrop. In reality, the monarchy of the time was highly regarded for their concern for the people, eg the queen's refusal to leave the palace when London was bombed. They could have made a little bit more out of this I think.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[9]]<br>I thought the film was great, especially , Colin Firth's performance. I  thought that Guy Pearce  was poorly cast; not quite comfortable  for me.  I found G Rush's interpretation of the therapist grating not quite believable given the time. I seriously doubt any Australian would have assumed that style AND used terms like "mate' , especially in that context. Way too much emphasis on the Australian colonial Ocker. Sacriligious I know but too many iconic Aussie actors are too self conscious, like  Cate Blanchett. Never lets you forget who you're watching.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[9]]<br/>Great film performances brilliant - agree with David re Churchill and Archbishop a little over the top, but didn't ruin the film.  Firth and Rush should take out major awards.  The Brits seem to make great films on very small budgets.  Aussie scripts lack nuance and depth.  I portrays its time.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[10]]<br/>A classic and deeply moving for anyone who was involved or has an interest in this period. Tremendous direction and performances from firth and rush. Margaret gave this  four stars as she gave unstoppable. It's worth a lot more than this. Am beginning to wonder if David and Margaret actually see the movies they review. They always seem out of rich with the reviews from the general public like myself - just a thought.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[7]]<br/>A well made movie with excellent performances from the two main characters.  I certainly cannot have enough of Geoffrey Rush, whichever role he is playing.  The main theme of the relationship between two people with completely different backgrounds and personal histories is very well done and resonates significantly.  Otherwise, I am troubled by the glorification of the monarchy, and I also have problems with a "happy ending" which involves the ruler of one country declaring a war.  A very good movie for the acting, then.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[6]]<br/>Positives were the excellent acting and the recreation of the era.  Negatives were the film was too long and the subject matter became rather tedious.   In particular some of the King's long speeches reproduced word for word.   I was overall rather disappointed given all the rave reviews I'd read.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[9]]<br/>Wonderful historical piece.<br/>Cried at the end.  My father fought in the WW2.<br/>Lost him 35 years ago.  To listen to a speech delivered in such a difficult manner, by someone I knew very little about was very moving.  It  was a speech that probably prompted my father to volunteer.  The war changed his life and mine.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[9]]<br/>One of the best films of the year for me. It is all in the acting, I found that the performances were so good by everyone that I looked past those small strange things that Margaret and David; which was a why it was so good for me. Special mention to Geoffrey Rush, Guy Pearce and Helena Botham Carter; but all the actors are superb and it is a great script and great story. Colin Firth stole the show though, with one of the most believeable, attention-to-detail to characters I've ever seen. A really great film!</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[8]]<br/>I think the film was brilliant, and the wall you refer to is stunning. <br/> One side of that wall was original, the other sides were recreated to match by the set designers.<br/>The reason the original wall looks the way it does, is from years and years of layers of paint, wallpaper and glue that someone had unsuccessfully tried to remove, to see what the wall underneath all the layers actually looked like.<br/>Very fitting, to my mind, as the backdrop to a 'therapists' room...Wouldn't you agree?</p>

The story was well told and there were some truly brilliant, memorably moments. Timothy Spall and Guy Pearce were both highly amusing in their roles. Beautiful cinematography, very entertaining film.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[10]]<br/>Can't add too much to what's already been said but this was one of my favourite films for a long time. Both main actors were fantastic, but especially Rush who brought such humanity and compassion to the role. I really enjoyed the wit of both. Whereas a few people have said it was a little long, tendious or repetitive, I felt just the opposite. I loved the scenes between Rush and Firth so much that I would have liked there to have been MORE, not less.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[8]]<br/>I am one of the few who are not up to scratch with the history depicted in "The King's Speech". So this film worked as an educational one of sorts for me while being very entertaining throughout. Every frame that Rush &amp; Firth feature in together are the film's finest moments. They have great chemistry, two fabulous performances! Their performances are certainly aided by sophisticated writing that is both risible and powerful at intervals. Costume and Set Design are elaborate and the story a very worthy one of being told. A great night out at the pictures! 4 stars.</p>

I thought that it was a little slow in parts and still it left me feeling a bit cheated concerning the fleshing out of the characters within the film. It felt authentic by virtue of the historical references which stimulated a desire to find out more about the royals. (not being a royalist). Definitely worth seeing...</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[10]]<br/>Brilliant, it was the best film I have seen in many years. I recommend it for its historical content and for showing the ability within individuals for overcoming their fears when others believe in you, no matter who they are. I feel closer to the Royal family now.</p>

I'm sure Paul Keating would get a kick out of Geoffrey Rush's character whose irreverence towards the royals was a hoot. A very humane look at  the friendship between two unlikely people.

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[9]]<br/>On every level, this is a deeply satisfying film.The interplay between the King and the therapist run the gamut of emotion, class differences, the clever social touches which put us squarely into the era- and hints at darker forces than just Wallis Simpson as the reason for the abdication. The final speech left me with cracked knuckles, from wring my hands to encourage Bertie. First class, what?</p>

Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth and Helena Bonham-Carter were all superb in this film.  It's very involving and also quite funny (which surprised me).  I found that a few people near me (including myself) were very moved when he accomplished his successful speech.  Guy Pearce is also very good as Edward.   <br/></p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[6]]<br/>I, too, thought, the 'treatment' room a bit odd'<br/><br/>I was a bit put out with the 'pick the ageing actor' element -  Gambon, Spall, Jacobi, Andrews and Bloom.<br/><br/>I thought Firth to have created a better performance than Rush, but did not like the character created by HBC. Queen Elizabeth was more twee and off with the fairies, even at that early stage. <br/>I had so looked forward to this film, but came out not fussed to see it again. If it is any indicator of my lack of taste, I disliked 'The Social Network' very much.</p>

If  Bertie's speech flowed so well when reading with music played to him loudly via ear-phones , why wasn't this technique used when giving his war-time speech [.This was done in private ]</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[9]]<br/>I loved it for all the same reasons everyone else has, so I'll only comment that  I did not like one performance, that of Logue's wife. Poor because the Australian accent was excruciating, rather like Meryl Streep's version of Lindy Chamberlain. Why would they use an English actress in such a role? The answer of course is that she is played byJennifer Ehle (aka Elizabeth Bennett), a nice little wink to the audience who first saw Colin Firth as Mr Darcy! But surely they could have had a better voice coach.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[10]]<br/>Anne, A story in The Canberra Times  last Tuesday January 4 tells of Canberran Hazel Morris, now 86 years of age, whose elder brother had a stammer  - the family often despaired about his future. When their father, working in plain clothes in the Police Force, was driving behind King George Vl as he went to his appointments with Mr. Logue, he mentioned his son to one of the king's entourage. Before long, he was able to meet with Mr. Logue. The 13 year old son was cured with the same methods - he kept his shilling in a box.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[10]]<br/>I saw the movie while visiting relatives. It does a great job of portraying the everyday frustrations of those of us who stutter. Hopefully, seeing the movie and/or reading the reviews will make everyone interested in learning tips for talking with someone who stutters by the Stuttering Foundation (www.stutteringhelp.org). People still think that telling us to "slow down" or "take a breath" are helpful, but they are not. Firth did a great job of getting into his role as if really were the King experiencing those blocks!</p>

I would agree with Helsta, Helean Bonham-Carter performance was spot on (the less she gives the ease of belief of character). All the Aussie quirks from Mr Rush was a hit with the packed cinema.

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[10]]<br/>What a brilliant film in every way. Perhaps I can clear up Matt's confusion. When Bertie (Duke of York) became King his consort (Elizabeth) became Queen. When the King (Bertie) died his eldest daughter, Elizabeth, became Queen &amp; her mother became the "Queen Mother". Had she not been a Queen herself she would have been referred to as the "Queens Mother" The present Queen always referred to her mother as Queen Elizabeth.</p>

I thought this was a stunning film with a beautiful story, stunning acting and great humour, delived mostly by Rush's character. There was instant applause from the packed Canberra audience when the credits rolled. And as for that wall in Lionel Logue's treatment room? Slightly eccentric and unqualified, just like its tenant.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[9]]<br/>Nearly a perfect film. Beautifully written, acted, and realised account of that time in Royal history. Firth and Rush must be Oscar endowed for their work. Bonham Carter was a delightful and truly supporting player in the movie. My only qualms Jennifer Ehle and Guy Pearce. Bad casting on both counts. Ehle's Aussie accent is awful - surely any number of  superb Aussie thesps could have performed better. Guy Pearce was meant to be older, he neither looked it, nor is in actuality (Firth is 50, Pearce 43). But aside - it is a rousing, heartfelt and thoroughly entertaining expereince!</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[10]]<br/>Brilliant movie, captures a momentous period of English history perfectly.  Amazing acting from Rush, Firth &amp; Bonham-Carter and supporting cast (who's who of English acting).  Very emotive - you agonise for poor Bertie trying to get those words out, feeling his embarrassment and anger.  But the comedy is also delicious, the wordplay between Rush &amp; Firth is hilarious.  And who knew that King George VI had such a bad stutter?!</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[8]]<br/>An original concept, based loosely on historical fact, this clever, lively film was finely acted, especially by Bonham Carter.  It was also superbly edited.  When on the odd occasion a sequence threatened to stall or strained for attention (too much close up face-pulling by Firth, for instance), suddenly the pace changed and we were engaged again.  The producers took a gamble casting Ehle as Rush's wife since we all know she is really Mrs Darcy.  Perhaps that interfered with her performance here, which was not entirely successful. The 'distracting' room was to be repapered with new wallpaper in the end.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[10]]<br/>I laughed, I cried and was uplifted by those two men who had no recognised credentials for their professional careers. Might I mention the German music? Mozart to mask the stutter for Bertie and the Largo from Beethoven's 7th Symphony was a powerful tension builder in the final scenes. It amplified the sadness and courage of the King's Speech. Those glimpses of the workers listening to the broadcast were a magnificent touch. Bravo!</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[9]]<br/>Brilliant first movie for 2011! I loved seeing all my favourite actors together - a true feast. Colin Firth was superb - extra poignant in his struggle. The music was well chosen too, especially the Beethoven piece used for the actual speech, to gradually lead us along, holding our collective breath, while Bertie gained confidence. Bravo all!</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[10]]<br/>This was the best film of 2010 for me. If Colin Firth doesn't win best actor oscar for his work here, something is very wrong.  The scenes with Rush and Firth were just captivating.  During other scenes of the film, I just kept wanting to get back to the action of their therapy sessions.  Fantastic film with awesome performances from Rush and Firth, and Guy Pearce in a Pantomime villain kind of a way.</p>

Must see, gives a peek into the life of Royalty - and not a particularly flattering one.  Helena Bonham-Carter as the wife of George VI gives a very flattering performance of a wonderfully, supportive woman.</p>

Great cinematography and editing, especially using genuine footage and sound in parts. <br/>Can't believe Margaret &amp; David managed to get distracted by the well and minimally designed therapy room, or that they rated it only 4.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[8]]<br/>A very fine film: quality script and superb performances by Firth and Rush as well as the support cast (although not sure about Guy Pierce, who was too flippant  in his role). I liked the attention to detail, the BBC 'engine' room, the street scenes, and costumes. Old fashion story-telling without the show-offish jerky camera work and rapid-editing, which are commonplace these days.</p>

I was truly moved by this portrayal and I can see the links to the skills developed in "A single man".<br/>Geoffrey Rush has never been better, His wit and timing made for a truthful portrayal of the Australian heart. He was so dignified and at the same time irreverent. These men portrayed the development of a deep friendship with a truth that resonated throughout the audience. <br/>Great cinema.

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[7]]<br/>Am I the only rain cloud?  I thought the film was faced with the unenviable difficulty of creating tension when we all knew the main plot turns in advance, and struggled a bit on that count.  I felt it relied on the inevitable and predictable juxtapositions of ozzie bloke on king, ha ha funnies about the king swearing his head off, and perhaps a call to any last vestiges of sentiment we might have about the monarchy and all things true Brit.  Some great lines, some great actors, but I found it a bit mawkish.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[9]]<br/>I loved this film. Like some others who've commented, I didn't see Colin Firth as a particularly interesting actor before, but having seen him in this, my view has certainly changed. I was utterly captivated by his performance as the stammering King, and truly felt the agony of his struggle to speak clearly. Any actor who can forge that sort of connection between their character and the audience is a master of their craft. As Anne comments, it's a rare film that moves the audience to applaud at the end. This was one of those films.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[9]]<br/>To see the recent lines at national cinemas that file out through cinema doors just to see "The King's Speech" is phenomenal, however not surprising. The tour de force performances from Firth, Rush, and Bonham Carter strongly uplift the film whilst Tom Cooper's direction leads the story in a well-paced, exciting fashion. It offers such a delicious insight into the going ons of Britain's monarchy at such a turbulent time in history and truly does a remarkable job of informing, and entertaining to such an extent that we cannot help but fall in love with "The King's Speech".</p>

If this isn't worth five start what the hell is?<br/>Thank God for a literate script and two actors at the height of their powers doing wonders with it.<br/>It's a very human film. It shows how people of all walks in life can struggle to cope with their circumstances, few knowing the  courage and grit it takes to put one foot in front of another day after day. It makes you fall in love with the human race again. Not much on screen at the moment encouraging that sentiment.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[5]]<br/>This is certainly a handsome film with some standout performances.  However, I did find some of the longer scenes depicting Bertie's struggles to speak somewhat tedious and repetitive.  This impression was reinforced by the repeated use of the close-up.  Some sharper editing here would have helped enliven the pace of the film and relieve the static, staged nature of some of the scenes.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[7]]<br/>This should have been a 4-star film, but the print at the Dendy multiplex was so bad that it was hard to get beyond the blur and the constant change of film stock colour. Nonetheless, with a bit of imagination, The King's Speech was a nice, well acted but small film: nothing big, nothing fancy, more like a well-produced stage production of a bit of little-known British/Australian history. GR was outstanding as always.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[9]]<br/>Fantastic - and an unknown story.  I think for me the most interesting bit was the development of trust for the King in his therapist - who until then had only known trust with one person - his wife.  That enabled the therapy to work.</p>

I think all three deserve an Oscar. <br/>The King's speech at the end of the movie was so moving - I still feel emotional thinking about it.  Congratulations to all involved in the making of the movie.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[10]]<br/>An inspiring story contrasting the lives and position of theprivelidged royal with his speech impediment and his empathetic therapist from the colony. The cast fit their roles perfectly and the setting of the therapists studio enhances the contrast between the lives of the main characters. I would be interested to know what degree of research went into the events portrayed as the film gives an interesting insight into the lives of the characters portrayed.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[10]]<br/>An outstanding film. Colin Firth ought to win an Oscar (if that's possible, given that he's a British actor in a British film) for his brilliant portrayal of George VI. His stutter and his frustrated resignation to it was totally convincing.  I'd seen the promo short and thought the film looked OK, if a bit simple and predictable, but the experience of seeing the film itself was different. It successfully recreated the feel and gravity of the era. Yes, Rush and Bonham Carter are excellent in their roles too, but it's Colin Firth who stands out for me . <br/></p>

There was a good mix of drama and wit, some of the scenes between Rush and Firth had  great comedic flair, I didn't expect that.  Loved it!, will definitely be adding it to my DVD library.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[8]]<br/>I really liked this film. All of the acting performances were first rate, the script was good and the picture had something to say about Bertie, about Lionel and David (not Stratton). Not only that, it was also beautifully shot, making terrific use of a host of inside and outside locations.<br/><br/>I was left wondering whether it was really about the abdication of Edward VIII rather than his brother's stammer.<br/><br/>I hope Colin Firth gets his Oscar for this.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[8]]<br/>A real actors's movie - no pyrotechnics or Hollywood bull.... But to balance rave reviews, there is a slight degree of irritation when dealing with history. Logue was appointed an MVO in 1937 and Bertie made a good fist of his speech opening our Parliament House in 1927 - 12 years before his (wartime) speech. Princess Elizabeth was 13 and a half when 'The Speech' was made in 1939 - not the little 9-10 year old portrayed. In short, I enjoyed the sentiment of the film but it seems that most filmakers feel a need to resort to some crowdpleasing.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[7]]<br/>Yes - a really good movie BUT I did feel that the politics around King George V and the Duke of Windsor was downplayed.  Both were very right wing and luke-warm Nazi sympathisers, if not supporters.  King George VI was simply the son who ahd to take the job.  I question whether King George V really believed that Bertie was the best person for the job...I suggest that was the script writers imagination.<br/><br/>But great acting by all three leads - especially Rush.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[10]]<br/>A wonderful movie that felt very real; no Hollywood glitz in this movie. Typical British masterly of an important piece of history that lifts and inspires. Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth, Helena Bonham-Carter and Guy Pearce should be very proud of their performances.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[10]]<br/>The poorly painted, peeling wall shows how poor the family was that they lived in such improverished and gloomy surroundings.  Later on, they are depicted living in much better accomodation with pretty blue walls and nice furniture.  It was a rather obvious symbolic device to show their rise in the world.  I loved this film and thought it was very well cast - mind you, I could watch the test pattern for hours if it featured Colin Firth.  I doubt whether it will win any (American) Academy Awards, however, since its depiction of (American) Wallis Simpson was not portrayed sympathetically.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[9]]<br/>It's not often I am thoroughly satisfied with a movie these days. (Probably getting too old and cranky) but this did it for me. Firth and Rush are both excellent in their respective roles as is Helena Bonham Carter.  Surely some Oscars<br/>among those. Agree with David that the weak links were the portrayals of Churchill and the Archbishop. Hence the deduction of half a star!</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[10]]<br/>This is one of the finest films I have seen in this modern age,The performances, wonderful music and the splendid settings were reminscient of earlier fine British films  of the 40's..  Geoffrey Rush and Colin Firth were uniformly excellent and Colin's performance at the last brought me to tears as I watched him painfully but successfully bring in his first wartime speech.  Helena Bonham-Carter and Guy Pearce were also excellent and totally believable.  This film makes those of us who can remember King George V1 (just) proud to have such a really fine film made of their lives and tribulations.</p>

The only other films to come close to this in 2010 (for me) were A Single Man and Animal House, which were both amazing as well. But The King's Speech made me happy and sad and moved and astonished.

One of the best for the year because of the great acting of all the principles, great script and an inspirational story. The courage to face your demons is a story worth telling. Such sensitivity to the anguish of all characters, the reluctant leader, the courageous wife and the stroppy professional  told with humour and acted with passion makes a  wonderful yarn</p>

However, for me, the highlight was Helena Bonham-Carter- she portrayed the character of the Queen Mother with such sympathy, and you could completely empathise with the pain she experienced for her husband. A great story, and perfectly executed.</p>

Not sure how factually portrayed Mr Logue's techniques were as I don't believe that he documented them.

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[9]]<br/>I think Geoffrey Rush is one of THE most believable actors ever, and he seems to be able to lend himself to any role. I don't think I have ever seen Colin Firth in a role I didn't like either and Guy Pearce was a fantastic choice, at times he even looks like Edward VIII. If David &amp; Margaret were distracted by the walls in the scene, all I can say is that they are easily distracted. I found the performances riveting to the point where the walls didn't exist, even when watched a second time. A classic for sure.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[7]]<br/>Colin Firth has a career resume of tired, mediocre movies to his credit, if credit is the right word (but then he's often tired and mediocre).  He's finally appearing in a really fine movie, and with a little help from his friends he's really good.  However, do you think, if he wins the oscar (keep reading that he will) for this movie, do you think he will then become the next Adrian Brody?</p>

I disagree with David re. Timothy Spall and Derek Jacobi. In particluar Spall was outstanding. I'm sure there would have been crticism had he not tried to act like the real Churchill. Firth is a shoe-in for the Best Actor Oscar and the film ought to win the Best Film Oscar, ahead of The Social Network, another brilliant movie.<br/>The only crticism is when Rush's wife meets the King and Queen Consort. It was a bit trite.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[9]]<br/>A beautifully told true myth of developing masculinity that virtually comes of age. Well used hero's journey structure. Margaret and David, the shabby wall in Logue's office sat opposite a beautiful wall of antique timber furnishings perfectly visually  illustrating the class difference between the two men.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[10]]<br/>I agree with Margaret and David that because of the performances, the brilliance of this film is achieved.  I felt the self-degradation experienced by the king because of his affliction and relished the interplay between king and speech therapist.  Very engrossing and enjoyable film.  <br/>Matt , HB Carter's Elizabeth is Queen when Bertie her husband is crowned King.  She becomes Queen Mother, only when her daughter Elizabeth, by right of blood, succeeds her father and is crowned Queen.</p>

The acting was superb and I don't know how Colin Firth was able to make all the facial expressions trying to speak.  Hats off to his acting ability and I hope big awards come his way.  Really Really enjoyed this movie.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[10]]<br/>"The King's Speech" is a truly wonderful film. Great acting, terrific set design, inspiring subject matter - the whole package really.<br/>Like a lot of women, I'm madly in love with Colin Firth, but in spite of my rose coloured glasses, his is a masterful performance. I wondered how he would fare next to Geoffrey Rush - the actor's actor - but he held his ground confidently.<br/>I wondered if my husband would like the film considering he is NOT in love with Colin Firth, but he was as entranced as I.<br/>I can see a sackful of awards on the horizon.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[9]]<br/>@matt,<br/>Yes, she was Queen Consort, but convention has her referred to as simply the Queen; but fulfilling a very different constitutional role to her daughter as Queen-in-right. She became the Queen Mother (or Dowager) after the death of her husband in 1952.<br/><br/>Great movie, doesn't attempt treat the audience like idiots as most historical films are wont to do.</p>

<p class="comment">((The King's Speech))[[9]]<br/>I thought it was excellent! Setting/atmosphere photographed with integrity; Firth and Rush brilliant.  <br/><br/>Only complaint  -  with concluding comments, the writing was too small  - we can't all read small print easily! <br/><br/>Answer to query above:  The wife of a reigning king is called a queen consort. -  husband of a reigning queen usually not called "king consort".<br/><br/>In general, consorts of monarchs have no power per se. ..However, often the queen consort of a deceased king (queen dowager or mother) has served as regent while her child, the successor to the throne, was still a minor (thanks to Wikepaedia)!</p>
