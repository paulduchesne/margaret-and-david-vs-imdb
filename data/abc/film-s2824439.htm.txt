<p class="description">A Muslim suffering Asperger's syndrome is detained by authorities in the US for suspicious behaviour...</p>
<p class="score" style="border:0;"> Margaret: <img alt="three-and-a-half stars" class="rating" src="/web/20140228024021im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/img/bthree-and-a-half.gif"/> </p>

<h3>My Name is Khan</h3>
<p class="ratd"> Rated <em>M</em></p>
<p><em>Review by Margaret Pomeranz</em></p>
<p>MY NAME IS KHAN is a Indian film that we didn't review when it was first released because there were no previews. It's had a simultaneous release around the world and is breaking box office records for a Hindi film. <br/><br/>Set mainly in America where Rizwan Khan - played by Bollywood superstar SHAHRUKH KHAN - moved with his mother to live with his brother. Rizwan is autistic, he has Asperger's Syndrome but that doesn't prevent him establishing a lovely relationship with single mother Mandira - Kajol...<br/><br/>The film is nearly three hours long, with a ten minute intermission. The first part is really the romance that develops between Rizwan and Mandira, the second part moves into darker territory as Rizwan, a Muslim, and his family experience the backlash caused by 9/11.<br/><br/>Directed by the very successful Karan Johar, the film is shamelessly manipulative, a real tear jerker, it certainly jerked them out of me. Kajol is lovely as Mandira and Shahrukh Khan is affecting as the Asperger's-affected hero on a mission to meet the President of the United States. <br/><br/>It is very like Forrest Gump; its message, which is that people are either good or bad, regardless of their ethnicity or religion, comes through loud and clear. The music, such a feature of Indian cinema is terrific, is largely on the soundtrack, with no big song and dance numbers. <br/><br/>I'd give the film 3 and a half stars.</p>

Forestgump-ish rizwan helpin out ppl from disaster, that hurricane bit is RIDICULOUS. climax is shady.<br/>male lead should have controlled his  expressions a bit.  i was yawing after 35 minutes in the cinema. it could have been easily trimmed down to half hour mayb. lol.<br/>all in all, bad bollywood experience.  </div><div class="MYNAMEISKHAN"><em class="dd">8/03/2010 12:23 AM</em><em>Name</em>: Mirwais<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140228024021im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.gif"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: it is such a great film, beautifully acted by Shahrukh Khan and the storyline is very attention grabbing. The movie promotes peace and humanity and there are a lot of good hidden messages in the movie. some of which are that in this world, either you are a good person or a bad person, religion is not the criteria, humanity is. A person should not be targetted based on their name and religion.  Terrorism has no religion and that should be clear. <br/><br/>We must repair the world with love which is what the film is trying to say. </div><div class="MYNAMEISKHAN"><em class="dd">7/03/2010 9:01 PM</em><em>Name</em>: Hardy<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140228024021im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars9.gif"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: sensationally emotive,thoughtprovoking and it makes you glad to be human.<br/>It is one of my favourite movies and I hope that word of mouth keeps this movie in the cinemas longer then planned as I want to take some of my friends and family to see this movie. </div><div class="MYNAMEISKHAN"><em class="dd">7/03/2010 1:38 PM</em><em>Name</em>: Chris<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140228024021im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars7.gif"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Really enjoyed the 1st three-quarters of the movie but it lost a little with me towards the end when Khan became 'Forrest Gump-ish' in his global appeal. Great overall appeal that should have had more screens from a greater box-office, for the overall message from the movie was undeniable.  </div><div class="MYNAMEISKHAN"><em class="dd">6/03/2010 7:06 PM</em><em>Name</em>: jasleenkk<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140228024021im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.gif"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: its amazing and srk rockks </div><div class="MYNAMEISKHAN"><em class="dd">6/03/2010 7:02 PM</em><em>Name</em>: akshay jain<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140228024021im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.gif"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: mind blowing, best performance of srk </div><div class="MYNAMEISKHAN"><em class="dd">6/03/2010 8:41 AM</em><em>Name</em>: Raj<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140228024021im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.gif"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Beautiful movie!

Is it called a review in the first place? It's only got things that we already know! And, most importantly... the film's msg is not- people are either good or bad!!

I thought it was fascinating to see many aspects of the US from the perspective of an indian film.  Shahrukh Khan's role as a person with Asperger's syndrome was a great mechanism to put very complex issues into a surprisingly simple light, and it's also a major advance for advocacy for people with autism.  The music is gorgeous too!   </div><div class="MYNAMEISKHAN"><em class="dd">5/03/2010 5:28 PM</em><em>Name</em>: EKTA SHARMA<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140228024021im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.gif"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: amazing acting by shahrukh khan...movie was actually showing the mirror to american society and western culture against their weired perception towards muslims...it made me go laugh, cry and love it.  </div><div class="MYNAMEISKHAN"><em class="dd">5/03/2010 5:25 PM</em><em>Name</em>: ct-kama<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140228024021im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.gif"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: wonderful movie and very touched..;D </div><div class="MYNAMEISKHAN"><em class="dd">5/03/2010 5:13 PM</em><em>Name</em>: huda<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140228024021im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.gif"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: wonderful movie, with great acting, direction &amp; story, could anyone ask for more?<br/>the length was perfect, as the various parts contribute to the whole point, the only meaningful difference between people is always their actions, not race nor religion.<br/>wonerfuly told :) </div><div class="MYNAMEISKHAN"><em class="dd">5/03/2010 5:04 PM</em><em>Name</em>: karunakar<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140228024021im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars7.gif"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Is this movie appealing only to ppl who have travelled abroad atleast once?It was my experience with my familynfriends.<br/><br/>Tears ran down while i was watching the movie without my knowledge.I was so involved and moved with Rizwan Khan's acting. <br/>Ppl walking towards the flood victims while Rizwan is busy helping is my fav scene.<br/>I dont deny the fact that they are few logics missng as in like fbi unable to solve the mandira son's death mystery, openly speaking abt terrorism in a place with a new person(rizwan)joining the group etc.<br/>But on the whole it is a fantastic movie. </div><div class="MYNAMEISKHAN"><em class="dd">5/03/2010 4:03 PM</em><em>Name</em>: Sandi<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140228024021im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.gif"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Everyone who sees this movie again (and again and again) loves it more every time....Do yourself a favour and go see it again.

At the same time, a film like MY NAME IS KHAN is sure to have a far-reaching influence due to its noble theme.<br/>Shah Rukh's performance has little subtlety about it - for that watch Hugh Dancy doing Asperger's in Adam - but it is heartfelt, endearing and more controlled than anything he's ever done before.  </div><div class="MYNAMEISKHAN"><em class="dd">26/02/2010 5:13 AM</em><em>Name</em>: KHAN<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140228024021im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars4.gif"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: I LIKE  KHANS  MY NAME IS KHAN  </div><div class="MYNAMEISKHAN"><em class="dd">26/02/2010 1:32 AM</em><em>Name</em>: Usama Wajhi<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140228024021im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.gif"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: it was really a great movie... specially SRK's acting was really awsum....  </div><div class="MYNAMEISKHAN"><em class="dd">25/02/2010 5:56 PM</em><em>Name</em>: Nithin Muraleedharan<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140228024021im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars9.gif"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: INDEED!

<p class="comment">((My Name is Khan))[[9]]<br>I had the opportunity to see "My name is Khan" and I was struck and deeply surprised by the high quality of the film, the well versed plot and its development, and the impeccable actuation of Shahrukh Khan, representing the autistic character of the hero in the movie. The wonderful message of love prevailing over all forms of creed and the righteousness of action as prove of that love, surmounts by far borders of race, religion or philosophy, converting this movie in a real all times winner of Bollywood. Pleasant film with a message to meditate about.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((My Name is Khan))[[9]]<br>never have the mind about this film, never seen its previews flashed over the television. i just knew it,and how beautiful it was crafted   aboard a bus. The film really captures my attention and subsequently brings me to a more intense viewing and grasping its content  and emotional experience.I don't know when was the last time that a film brought me to tears, but this one does.<br>.two thumbs up for  SHAHRUKH KHAN superb acting  commends  acting nomination. his portrayal in a non-muslim country, displaying his faith. without hesitation of being incarcerated  is truly commendable . truly recommendable for viewing.</br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((My Name is Khan))[[9]]<br>Beautiful movie...as actors kajol and shahrukh deliver and Karan as a director proves how great he is. The movie makes you cry aswell as laugh appropriately..although some ideas were larger than life and may be looked at as too unrealisttic..it can not be denied that the message of the movie is sweet and simple..and overall is entertaining movie!</br></p>

<p class="comment">((My Name is Khan))[[0]]<br>This movie is Pathetic... Be Warned : All the people shouting how great the Movie/Acting/Story is, the truth is they want you to SUFFER as much as they did...<br><br>SRK overacted a retarded guy with no realism, the Storyline is 100% "INSPIRED" by Forrest Gump and the Soundtrack+Direction is equally pathetic.<br><br>If you are a big SRK Fan.. Do yourself a favour,,, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE..or you will end up Cursing the Superstar who might in future gives us all a good flick..</br></br></br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((My Name is Khan))[[7]]<br>My Name is Khan is quite a grand film really. A sweeping spectacle of romance and drama yet the film constantly brings laughter and will always be a feel good story. It has many flaws however. (SPOILER; Death by soccer ball? Hmm, if you insist. Entering Georgia in the middle of a catastrophic hurricane? C'Mon!!) Music at times feels out of place and overly dramatic and the production has an obvious B-Grade/Amateurish production, However the beautiful and endearing characters keep this good hearted, well intentioned film always entertaining and engaging. A very good 2.4 hour experience overall!</br></p>

<p class="comment">((My Name is Khan))[[10]]<br>i love you srk.  it is such a great film, beautifully acted by Shahrukh Khan and the storyline is very attention grabbing. The movie promotes peace and humanity and there are a lot of good hidden messages in the movie. some of which are that in this world, either you are a good person or a bad person, religion is not the criteria, humanity is. A person should not be targetted based on their name and religion. Terrorism has no religion and that should be clear.</br></p>
