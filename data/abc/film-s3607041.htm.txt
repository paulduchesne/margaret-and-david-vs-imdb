<h2>The Intouchables</h2>
<p class="ratd"> Rated <em>M</em></p>
<p><em>Review by David Stratton</em></p>
<p>Philippe, FRANCOIS CLUZET, a millionaire who has been paralysed from the neck down after a para-gliding accident, hires Driss, OMAR SY, a Senegalese man out on parole after taking part in a robbery, as his carer. The no-nonsense Driss wastes no time in getting his employer out of the stuffy atmosphere in which he's been closeted, taking him out and about, getting him to smoke pot, introducing him to rock and roll.<br/><br/>THE INTOUCHABLES has been a huge box-office hit in France - the No 2 all-time success after WELCOME TO THE STICKS - and it seems certain to find a wide audience in the rest of the world. It's a feel-good, odd couple movie with, at the centre, a couple of terrific performances from Cluzet and Sy. There's a touch of DRIVING MISS DAISY in the idea of an uneducated black man bringing love and excitement into the life of his employer. DRIVING MISS DAISY was a period piece, and THE INTOUCHABLES is set in the present, when racial stereotyping, of the sort the film presents, is less acceptable. Without wanting to be too PC, I have to say that some people may find a great deal of this offensive in its ingrained attitudes. It also takes a decidedly tabloid approach to the arts in general: in this cosy world even a parolee from the ghetto can create a modern work of art and sell it for a lot of money - and the film also mocks classical music and opera.The writer-directors, Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache, don't go for subtlety, but they know how to make a crowd-pleaser; the problem is that if, while you're having a good time with these characters, you start to think about the wider implications of the film, you might find yourself somewhat less enthralled.</p>
<h2>Further comments</h2>
<p>DAVID: Margaret?<br/><br/>MARGARET: I hate to go against the box office of France but I found this pretty mediocre too. I think a lot of people are going to enjoy it but I think it also tries too hard to please that audience and it just shrieks, aiming at that middle bar. So while I think some of it is enjoyable, there is just a tinge of it that I did not respond to very well at all.<br/><br/>DAVID: Yes. So you felt about the same way I did, I guess.<br/><br/>MARGARET: I did, yes, which is a bit of a shame against all those French people.<br/><br/>DAVID: Yes. But there's no doubt that the two of them are very good, though. The two of them are very good.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Yes. No, there's joy to be had and he's a good dancer too. <br/><br/>DAVID: Sure.<br/><br/>MARGARET: So, hello. I'm giving it three stars though.<br/><br/>DAVID: I am too. Three stars.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[10]]<br>This is the best movie that I have ever seen, subtitles or no subtitles. <br>I have watched it 5 times in a week because I am so enamoured by the characters. <br>Ludovico Einaudi's brilliant musical score has renewed my passion for the classics, so much so that I will be adding his albums to my collection.<br>Both Francois Cluzet's &amp; Omar Sy's portrayal of Philippe &amp; Driss, repectively, were nothing short of magnificent.<br>Never again will I allow myself to be influenced by the tastes &amp; opinions of others. I may miss out on something special. H.S.<br> <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[10]]<br>Dear Margaret, dear David,<br>I understand why you couldn't enjoy it; you have to understand and to live the real French culture to understand the comic of this movie. Two different worlds, languages are crashing into each other. Only a French or a francophile who really knows the past and the nowadays French culture can laugh at the subtilities of those differences. Subtitles are not always helpful, they can sometimes destroy the charm, the character of a film (like in this case).<br>I am French, living in Australia with my francophile German husband and we both laughed to tears.</br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[8]]<br>Some of the comments on this film are more patronising than the misinterpreted comments of David and Margaret. But they're right, it does attack cultured tastes, which is possibly why people think it's hilarious. But if you go to France today, hoping to find it as you remembered, you'll find it's hugely changed.There are huge race issues, terrible cultural losses, reduced funding for the arts, and more Mc.Donald's than French bistros - so of course most people embrace the film. I enjoyed it more than David and Margaret did, but they do have a point.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[9]]<br>What a glorious film!  Perhaps having first hand knowledge of the culture and not having to read the subtitles gave me a head start?  I notice Margaret and David seemed to miss the fact that this film was based on a true story.  It's the only explanation for their odd, blinkered reviews. Highly recommend this film!</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[9]]<br>Perhaps the subtleties of the French, without knowledge of the language and the culture, were lost on Margaret and David? I loved this film. I guess having to read the subtitles (which never quite get it right) means you're more liable to miss the nuances that thankfully others clearly didn't.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[8]]<br>This is a beautiful, well made film, full of joy, with an excellent supporting cast as well as the outstanding lead performances David has at least credited. These values alone should raise it above the "above average" rating of 3 stars, whatever its ideology. Postcolonial theory is fine until it becomes a pretentious, prescriptive soapbox. Should we pretend there are no ghettos? Opera and classical are mocked but loved, David! His artwork is successful only because it's promoted by the aristocrat, but this comical statement it makes works for precisely this reason. Their relationship liberates, despite everything. Stereotypes are transcended.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[7]]<br>So true - this really is a feel-good, odd-couple movie with a touch of Driving Miss Daisy during present day Paris. Therefore, I'm genuinely surprised for the lack of enjoyment David and Margaret had with The Intouchables, a truly delightful movie with very warming performances and a heartfelt story to tell. Perhaps this is due to the mockery of art and classical music? Who could blame Driss, he isn't a person that has grown up around these niceties. And let's be honest, some "art" and its value is simply asking for ridicule! This is one film deserving of its success.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[8]]<br>What a silly, po-faced and ignorant review which completely misses the point. It seems that with any disability-themed film  D and M have a blind spot, pun intended. You both missed the sinister messages of "Million Dollar Baby" and "Amour" heaping praise on stories which advocated the murder of  people with disabilities (done with love so that made it all right!) and damn a film that depicts a truly loving, life affirming relationship between a quad and his carer. And the quad even gets to live!<br><br>Having had quadriplegia for 40 years I know which is the more accurate portrayal.</br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[3]]<br>I am going to swim against the tide and agree with Margaret and David's reservations. I watched this film the other night and at first laughed and was charmed, but then began to be troubled by the simplicity of the dichotomies -white arid intellectual, black joyful son of the soil. A touch too much of Rousseau's 'noble savage' for me here, I am afraid.</br></p>

I rarely disgaree with David's reviews but I feel he was on his uber high culture hobby horse when he reviewed this fresh and charming movie. A feel good important story with valuable scenes of what is the real Paris for many of its residents.</br></p>

The statement, "Even a parolee from the ghetto..." can make modern art and sell it, was extremely offensive and more essentialist and elitist than anything said in the movie.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[10]]<br>The critics were cerebral in their judgement -  they completely missed the vibrational energy that radiated between the stars -  making their acting spontaneous, natural and so palpable. <br><br>The directors and photographers captured the authentic emotions that were so masterfully intertwined into a simple and inspiring plot.   Every little nuance was connected to a point later, which provided for a very fast-paced movie.   <br><br>As a caregiver, woman of color, artist and lover of Earth, Wind &amp; Fire - this film really spoke to me like none has ever before.

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[10]]<br>I watched this on a flight from Brisbane to Perth. Wasn't expecting much but found myself to be completely rivited to it. It is a refreshingly different film, based on a true story, a movie that you can just simply enjoy. I work with spinal injuries clients so I found alot I could relate to and loved the relatively "simple" plot. You don't always want to watch something thats full on.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[9]]<br>Well I must agree with the general consensus here. I thought it was a thoroughly entertaining film. I loved the way that the story poo-pooed the PC constraints. I firmly believe anyone who is insulted by anything this film portrays has completely missed the point. The point is simply one of friendship and growth. Both men, and indeed the staff in the house, all became friends and grew a little. Both men were taken out of their respective comfort zones. A charming film ... I haven't laughed so heartily through a film in many a year.</br></p>

It was different to everything else in theaters nowadays and a truly beautiful story. I don't agree with Margret and David's ratings, although I can understand where they're coming from. My suggestion? Don't analyse it so much. It is beautiful because of its simplicity, don't search for more than you're given otherwise you'll obviously come up short. <br><br>Overall, I loved it.

I rarely disagree with both Margaret and David but I thought that this was a very funny and very uplifting film. If you avoid all stereotypes you never connect with some of those realities. Driss sees the potential humour in everything, whether high art, silly hairdos or serious relationships. He has a fresh and honest take on the world. Phillippe, who has lost so much in life, responds to his no shit outlook. Both actors were perfect in the roles.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[9]]<br/>What a pretentious review! "even a parolee from the ghetto"... "mocks classical music and opera!" Quelle horreur! It is disappointing to see that M&amp;D aren't distinguishing between what the characters are saying and what the film is saying. I thought it was beautiful, and Margaret is naive to think that the racial stereotyping portrayed in the film is outdated, especially in France, a nation that struggles enormously with xenophobia and its immigrant/refugee situation. Indeed, I find it refreshing to see a film that doesn't concern itself with making everything PC.. Leaves more room for the story..</p>

I can see where Margaret and David's harsh comments are coming from, but I've seen them advocating for suspension of disbelief enough times to wonder why they're getting so worked up over this film in particular.<br/><br/>I thought it was a wonderful, warm film with heart. It takes a little time to warm to the characters, but I honestly can't understand why Margaret and David weren't utterly charmed by it.<br/><br/>Perhaps they would rather the French stick to half-baked existentialist drivel?</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[10]]<br/>My French friend had been pushing me to see this film. I finally watched it here whilst on holiday in France. As usual, the French really know how to tell a story. What a beautiful film! I wanted the film to just keep on going. After the first scene, I said to my husband, this is going to be a good film.<br/>Margaret &amp; David - you really have to give away the game. What film were you watching? I agree with another reviewer, it was about abled/disabled.<br/>I've often waited for your opinions before a film - never again!</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[10]]<br/>A beautiful movie based on a beautiful book, which of course told a true story. I think to pretend that "racial stereotyping" was the basis of this movie is unfair. This was a classic story of rags to riches but the beautiful thing was it was possible to relate to the characters. I think most people who travel, know, that the opposites of the characters though cliched do exist. I think it is unfair to write off this film. It is truly fantastic!</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[8]]<br/>So many films have a 'rags to riches' (or at least a steady wage) theme, so this film was battling against a predictability tide. And there are moments that are unlikely - the rich guy would probably not have given up his seat in the opera scene.<br/>However, the undercurrent of awkwardness was overcome by the believable spontaneity of Omar Sy who won a heap of awards for his role and the plot wasn't anywhere near as treacly as it could have been (and has been so many times before).<br/>Audrey Fleurot is as sexy and enigmatic as ever.  <br/></p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[10]]<br/>I have to agree with the majority on this one brilliant movie. Made me cry made me laugh. I love foriegn movies and art house movies. I think Margaret and David so missed the aim of the movie which is exploring the  the unlikely friendship between two disadvantaged people. ..and it was done so well. So what if a bit of fun was poked at the stuffiness and pretention that can surround classical music and the arts. It interesting to see where our sensitivities lie.. A great movie...</p>

Can you imagine conceiving a plot like this let alone writing a screenplay that captures what it must be like for people in their respective 'prisons'? This was a joy and a delight to watch. Reprising an opening scene, now in context, is not unusual but in this film is clever and well crafted. "A tree singing in German"....still smiling over that one!</p>

I am a PSW caregiver, and thought to myself, i would love to be in that guy position, having someone to care for that trust me that way to give good care. I truly wish it was not subtitled in English so that I could morre focused on watching the movie, rather than trying to read. It is a beautiful, exhilarating and moving film wehich I truly love.</p>

Never have I seen Margaret and David so panned over review and I agree with the 'mob', M and D missed the boat on this one. Coming to terms with disability is the central core of the film. Yes its a crowd-pleaser but a very good one with a well told message. I also enjoyed Argo but was surprised it won an Oscar, this is a superior film.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[9]]<br/>This film is about disability and challenging attitudes towards disability. It is amazing how many reviews I have read that ignore this. Race, class, culture are themes but the point my dears, is that all difference can be transcended with humour, respect and above all, love.  I think this is a profound film, and very powerful. I work with those who have disability and would like all my staff to watch this. I am so pleased that the French minister for disability gave this film an award for the positive impact it has had on challenging perceptions of disability.</p>

The discrimination toward disability is handled in a subtle way, and the fact that the movie is based on real people makes a really heart warming conclusion. The music is also beautiful.

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[9]]<br/> review reads like the one by Roger Ebert. I thought Roger had the typical Anglo-Saxon cultural disease. If the movie would be recreated shot by shot in Hollywood, starring Will Smith and Harrison Ford, it would rain Oscars. Since it is French and, the French liked it, it can't possibly be appreciated in the Anglo-sphere. <br/>The movie was beautifully made, thought-provoking in its portrayal of a mismatch of socio-economic status bridged by fulfilling needs of very different kinds on both sides. As representatives of societies celebrating vulgar capitalism, maybe it is no surprise you were blind to this.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[9]]<br/>What a pompous review. I found the movie charming and hilarious. I viewed it as a message on how people with disabilities should be treated - just like everyone else. Both leads gave wonderful performances.<br/><br/>As for the supposed slight against opera and classical music, what rot. I love both and attend performances regularly and it's full of people that are there purely because they think it's the music that people of a certain class should listen to. Classical music and opera were the popular music of the time they were written. They're not above poking fun at.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[8]]<br/>I knew very little about this film , so I had no expectations . Yes, it was cliched in parts , however I sat back and enjoyed the ride . Lovely performances from the two leads. I feel M&amp;D have tried to intellectualise this movie and it doesn't need it. It 's a true story and one where two people learn from each other . How to be tolerant and compassionate and learn to laugh .Perhaps a lesson for us all (including M&amp;D).<br/>A really lovely film.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[9]]<br/>This was the first time i've been to the cinema in nearly a year and so glad I made the trip, this was thoroughly enjoyable. Yes it is a crowd pleaser but it was a different story and had a sense of hope that everyone can find themselves a purpose in life, regardless of racial background or physical boundaries. It made me laugh and feel a sense of warmth which I haven't felt in a movie in a very long time. Didn't check the time once, which is the true test of a good movie !</p>

Music was great. I missed some of the sub-titles as they were on a light background, only disappointment. David and Margaret should review for the general public, not the snobs. They are the odd ones out. This is far better than the rubbish coming out of America.</p>

Sorry Marg and David you need to stop looking at movies too critically but sit back and enjoy them for what they are. Like the general public does. I really think you are way off here and going by public opinion, it was a terrific movie. Also can't work out why the high rating for Argo which I also saw but not where as good as this.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[8]]<br/>As a Frenchperson raised where Omar is from, I thought the racial stereotyping was not overdone. <br/>Based on a true story, the film is also poignant and changes how you look at people with disabilities. Philippe agreed to the film only if done with humour, which explains the fun poked at upper class images. <br/>One liberty I did not like is the use of a Black actor, not a North African, as Omar really is.  My explanation is commercial : Black/White means more to key markets (USA) than North African/European which escapes most international viewers, although ingrained in French culture.</p>

You rated the completely off-base and cliched 'Argo' at 4.5? and rate this just a 3??? I mean, seriously?? <br/><br/>Come off your high (US-centered) horse..... This film was 100 times better than Argo - in every department including truthfulness. Argo manufactured half its story and omitted half the truth, and its acting was was decidedly ordinary compared to the brilliance of both Cluzet and Sy. <br/><br/>And the world of "high art" is pathetically pretentious, so please don't hold it against the film for calling it out.</p>

Rather than quibble over the preposterous notion that this film is offensive due to racial stereotyping, why not revel in a throroughy enjoyable story where someone with so little can give so much to a man who seemingly has everything. <br/><br/>Five stars every day of the week.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[8]]<br/>After David's review and some of the comments below I'd almost decided against seeing it, fearing it shamelessly lampooned classical music and art for a cheap middle-brow laugh, but that would have been wrong. It shows a collision of cultures, but as a lover of classical music I didn't feel it was ridiculed. If you have never recognised any hint of pretentiousness in an art gallery or a concert audience, you could choose to be offended. It would still be a choice though. Easily enough colour, complexity and depth for 4 stars in my book.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[8]]<br/>I found this to be a wholly hilarious film that gave me absolutely no insight into disability or french social relations. <br/>I don't agree that this film could justly be termed offensive on the grounds of racial stereotyping. In fact I think, with the exception of Sy's backstory and taste for totally excellent funk music, his race was incidental in the themes and narrative of this film.<br/>I would see this film if you're looking for max hilarity... perhaps not if you're searching for a thesis topic. It just doesn't spend that much time on anything other than humorous set pieces.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[8]]<br/>I think you have missed the point of the film entirely. You mentioned this notion of race and societal barriers as key elements of the film. They aren't. Dissability is the key theme to the movie, and it deals with the concept incredibly well. It's a film about treating the disabled as if they are like everyone else, which is portrayed perfectly through the  interaction of the two main characters.<br/>The film celebrates the diversity of people brilliantly. <br/>I was really touched by this film, I think you've missed the point.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[10]]<br/>Reading some of the comments so far suggests that there are some people out there in their ivory towers, taking themselves and their 'intellect' so seriously.  Undoubtedly these are the same people who tut tut and say the poor incapacitated man, we must care for him and protect him.  <br/>Yes I love classical music and the arts, but can see the funny side of the send ups in this film.  At the end of the day the film is heartwarming, very amusing, well shot and has a great soundtrack (heaven forbid even featuring classical music).</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[6]]<br/>I enjoyed the film while watching it, but upon reflection the handling of the subject matter does feel a little tired and stereotypical - and dare I say superficial. I'm just not sure I totally believe the central relationship as presented by the filmmakers, despite spirited and engaging performances by Cluzet and Sy.</p>

No plot worth speaking of, obvious humour, pathetic dialogue and totally predictable.<br/>This is in the mold of Forest Gump etc As it tries to convince us that anything intellectual is necessarilly dull and boring. It mocks classical music and pretends that a superficial relationship with a moron is more "fun" than a deeply intelligent one. I feel sorry for people who think this way. My opinion of the French has sunk to an all time low<br/></p>

I usually value M+D comments, however in this case I am shocked by their comments. There are racial stereotypes that are played with in this movie, but only when we stop laughing about them we have a problem as a society. Living in a mixed race relationship myself, poking fun of each others stereotypes can be great fun. And although I work in an artistic profession, it would be sad if we couldn't laugh at our own pretentiousness, just because something is 'art' it is not untouchable...</p>

I watched this with an intelligent French speaking black person who thinks if you review this negatively because of racial stereotyping  and you are white you are being nothing more than a pompous trouble maker. People need to stop being so precious and high and mighty at times and instead just have a good frigging laugh.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[6]]<br/>I laughed along, mainly half heartedly, as I was with a friend who chose supposedly an uplifting movie. To me it was contrived and stereotypical and aimed at middle class, middle aged white people who could feel comfortable and come to like the black guy as he was clearly so non-threatening. It just left me feeling somewhat baffled as to why we would continue this stereotyping in this day and age. The best part was watching Driss dance.

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[2]]<br/>One for the "Picasso is bullshit. My seven year old daughter could do what he does" mob, this is a basic crowd pleasing film where any artistic expression above the middle ground is relentlessly bashed and humiliated by the fish out of water streetwise (but lovable) character who, bien entendu, manages to turn around the stuffy life of the rich (but not totally unredeemable) bourgeois to make him a better man. Some scenes like the ridiculing of modern art, opera, classical music are hard to forgive. Manages some touching moments due to the reliable and solid Cluzet.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[9]]<br/>I liked  this film very much.   The relationship between the carer and caree  seems to have been  a complementary one. Quite engaging actually.  The actors' performace was superb and the music was very good too.  There are very few films about persons with disabilities and it is refreshing to see that once in a while, one comes to the screen.</p>

I would imaging "very loosely based on a true story" more like it .I wasn't amused or entertained at the  actions of the carer  Dangerous, suicidal driving(side-splitting), disrupting the audience at the opera. (Hilarious"). The painting sub-plot was ludicrous. I'm with David. I din't get into this. <br/>On the same day I saw  "The Master". Now, ther's a great movie.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[9]]<br/>What I liked was the portrayal of a man whose life partner has died and the anxiety he feels about getting involved with a new relationship - Driss, Eleonore or anyone else. I took his paralysis almost as a metaphor for the emotional paralysis that can become a part of grieving. The cheap shots at high art and culture were a bit irritating but, for me, the photography and the acting more than compensated.</p>

I always hold high regard for the reviews by Marg and Dave...and I almost didn't see this movie as a result of their opinions....but it was magnifique!! The acting was superb! Philippe and Driss are both truly endearing characters and have such depth, truth and 'humanity' about them. Loved it when Driss was taking the mickey out of the upper classes! I will be talking about this movie for ages....it will go down as one of my all time favourites...how dare you only give it 3 stars....snobbery...I'm quite stunned?!?</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[9]]<br/>Pity both M&amp;D did not get it. Intouchable is anything but simply a 'feel-good' mediocre movie. Driss, his hard working auntie, and cousins who all live in the crowded HLM on the outskirts of Paris are so very real! If the relationship between Philippe and Driss is often funny, the gap depicted here between the have and the have-nots is terrifying. The movie also questions the intrinsic value of 'high culture', and stresses the importance of laughter. This movie has so many layers, apart from its funny overall stance!. Yes, M&amp;D need a joint quickly... to return to earth.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[8]]<br/>Sorry M/D you appear to have missed the intoxicating joy of this film. Three stars flies in the face of the positive response of the people we have spoken to about this in Noosa Heads, who not only saw it once, but many took their fathers, husbands, sons and daughters to see it, gladly watching it a second time only days after seeing it. Yes it's got minor flaws, but to call this feel good film with such fine performances mediocre,  is ridiculous! This time my dears you are truly out of touch with all of us who loved it!<br/></p>

Instead, it was in turn funny,<br/>delightful, kept you on edge with the girl's presence or not, at the restaurant, and  the final scenes with one being scared and the other in ecstasy!

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[8]]<br/>The interesting back story to this film is the plight of 'les noirs', the blacks of France.<br/><br/>I thought all of the acting performances were first rate. I can't understand how David can accuse this picture of racial stereotyping: it bends over backwards to make Driss non stereotypical, human even.<br/><br/>For me the question is whether it bends too far and becomes just  politically correct and/or 'feelgood'. But all things considered I think it finds its way through all this. I could not help comparing it (favourably) to the Butterfly and the Diving Bell.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[8]]<br/>I went in wanting to dislike this film as the premise sounded so preposterous and pretentious. But I laughed out loud several times and the performances of the two leads were excellent. One of the few times M&amp;D's critiques were wrong at the same time! I thought it interesting that what this film is actually about is a white aristocrat who possesses and appreciates every conceivable luxury / cultural artefact and whose black manservant, you realise, is the ultimate indulgence the rich guy has to have. Everyone avoids 'going there', I must say. Or doesn't notice. But it IS there.</p>

The movie describe a beautiful unlikely relationship, different culture, background, etc yet what transpired is that at the end they both learn from each other. I think movies like this should be made often rather than half of the movies you gave 5 stars that is absolutely thrash you end up without a glimpse of hope.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[10]]<br/>Great entertainment, and that after all is what I go to the movies for. Just the type of film I needed today, and David, if you wanted to avoid being too PC, you failed. You are extremely PC in this review, when in reality, life is not PC thank goodness.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[9]]<br/>Your comments unfortunately show that you really don't know what people want. We don't want politically correct rubbish that is destroying honesty and spontaneity.<br/>This is one of the best movies I have seen since 'As it is in Heaven' - another foreign film that broke box office records. <br/>It may not be a classic, but it is definitely leaps n bounds ahead of much of the Hollywood drivel being dashed out. <br/>:-)<br/><br/><br/></p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[9]]<br/>I can't remember a movie that made me laugh as much as this one. Brilliantly made and acted Top script that kept you engaged throughout.<br/>I didn't find the portayal of Driss's background descended into cliche or racial stereotyping. I don't think Driss's disparagement of art and music was any more than a portrayal of his character. <br/><br/>OK some parts were a bit predictable and perhaps naff like Driss's dance scene and the ubiquitous car chase but they didn't really detract from the overall enjoyment.<br/>Hats off to Ann Le Ny's role as Yvonne.</p>

Performances by Francois Cluzet as the millionaire Phillippe who has been paralysed and Omar Si as Driss the ex convict who cares for  him are excellent. The film is quite inspiring and should do well at the Oscars.</p>

But,gee, have we reached the stage  where critics are supposed to tear apart any lovely feel good film as the arts  and race are not given ,apparently , equal time. <br/>I laughed , I cried and had a real change of heart to the way I should respond to people with disabiliies.  Beautifully photographed  with a fantastic soundtrack!  Shouldn't leave much to complain about!<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[10]]<br/>Sorry M &amp; D - but you are far too precious sometimes - this is an outstanding film - funny, filled with hope and tears. The world needs films like this to show us how we can be, how we can hope  and live together.  This is based on a true story and as other co reviewers have pointed out something not mentioned by M &amp; D.<br/><br/>I wonder if being elitist gets in the way of actually enjoying a film.  There is a reason why this film is such a hit - because its so good.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[8]]<br/>Fortunately I saw the movie at the film festival before reading this review or it would have coloured my approach. I loved it at the time as did the rest of the audience (audience favourite for MIFF).<br/>The fact that it was based on a true life story is not mentioned in David or Margaret's comments. And the racial divide in Paris as in other cities is reality, not bigotry.<br/>Apart from all that serious stuff - the movie is sheer entertainment, with brilliant acting, good script and poignancy which is not overdone.<br/>Do audience favourites get automatic negative loading by reviewers?</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[10]]<br/>The opening car chase scene is one of the funniest starts to a film I have ever seen.  From that moment on I just knew I would love this film and I did.  As the flyer says, "You will laugh, you will cry, you will cringe" and I experienced all of these emotions.  And yes Margaret, Driss is a fabulous dancer.  Great entertainment and at times extremely poignant.  I must have been French in a previous life as I too rate this film up there with WELCOME TO THE STICKS.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[10]]<br/>This film is a poignant hymn to life, brimming with humour, honesty and bravery. I assume Margaret and David missed the UK Paraolympics 2012 ads in which they marketed the athletes as "super humans" thus, aiming to move away from the attitudes of "pity" that those with a disability often attract. I just finished a second viewing of the film, where the rest of my fellow audience members sat through the end credits, and then marvelled at the magic of The Intouchables. I for one will be repaying the cinema a visit to watch it again.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[9]]<br/>This is one of the best films I have seen in the past decade. So good I saw it twice in the same week. M&amp;D, seriously, I think it's time to give up the game and hand over to those a little more in touch? The 2 central characters are not very good, they are exceptional. The script is brilliant - witty, humorous yet tinged with pathos, while the score is a standout, beautiful sad music by Ludovico Einaudi.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[9]]<br/>This movie is so funny and incredibly touching, I want to go out and tell everyone to see it. For all its purported sterotypes, it's a reminder of how vulnerable we all are on our solitary journey through life, and that a real human connection - and an ecstatic embracing of living life now, crazily! - can make being alive beautiful, wondrous and hilarious. Go see it.</p>

<h3>Walrus and Duck :</h3>
<p class="date">28 Oct 2012 8:12:16pm</p>
<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[8]]<br/>Humorous yet touching, this movie struck a chord with both walrus and duck. The frank discourse between Phillipe and Driss was balanced by their jovial banter. It was also obvious that both characters took comfort in the relationship that provided each with valuable life lessons that would have ordinarily been out of their respective social realms. However it seemed to lack a thematic climax, although this was tempered by the clear bond that formed between the two as the movie progressed which was in a sense a bit of a startling realization that such a friendship could occur at all.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[8]]<br/>Get over yourselves, D &amp; M!<br/><br/>The Driss character could not be expected to know about art, classical music or opera. <br/><br/>I am a balletomaine and a classicist and I feel exactly as Driss does about modern and abstract art, some classical music and most operas. (That doesn't make me a philistine - just someone who knows exactly what I like and dislike.) I think Driss is the boy who pointed out that the Emperor was, indeed, naked! <br/><br/>If his character had sent up classical ballet, I would have found that equally hilarious!<br/><br/>Laughter prevailed at the movie session I attended!<br/><br/></p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[8]]<br/>I think Margaret and David have missed one significant issue that this film raised and that is how we, as a society, treat people with a disability. All other candidates for the job saw the disability and not the person. Driss, however, saw the man and treated him as a person rather than a patient.<br/>Well acted, well paced, not a slow moment and a significant message presented in a most appealing and often humorous way.<br/>A must see.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[8]]<br/>I just watched a documentary about Paris ghettos. To find a young man from those ghettos who has the wit, skills and wherewithal to look outside the projects for a better life is amazing. The fact these two got together in real life is extraordinary and they changed eachother's lives. One had money but was trapped in a body and a life that excluded him, by design or by fault from another path, the other had a blank canvas for life that could take him to the edge of the projects or to the edge of the world. Great journey</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[9]]<br/>David Stratton - you wrote in the Australian<br/>"at times borderline offensive in the depiction of a "lovable" black man."<br/>and touched on the issue again here. <br/><br/>I don't see how race was an issue at all in this film. It's about Driss, a somewhat shady guy who lives in the housing projects who is changed by his relationship with Phillipe - who is also changed by Driss. It's a wonderful movie and I think it's quite wierd that you felt the movie tried to make any sort of statement regarding race. I was mildly offended to read your review.</p>

Anyone who didn't see the humour in Driss taking the mickey out of the pretentiousness of "high" art, and opera ...well, that says more about the reviewer than the film.<br/><br/> D &amp; M - suck it up. There are lots of us who look at modern art as a joke and can only stand opera if we were handcuffed.<br/><br/>A great film that, deservedly, is getting Oscar rumours about it.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[9]]<br/>I think this is one of the best movies of the year.  It has great comedy in what is a tragic situation.  The mocking of the classical music and the opera are part of the perspective of Omar, what do you expect to?   And the view of art was wonderful that Omar (plot spoiler) could sell a painting for thousands of euro was wonderful when you consider what people will pay for what looks like a 5 year old could produce.  This is an outstanding movie and i was disappointed M&amp;D were so luke warm about it.</p>

Many of my friends would love `to act out' in the same way as Driss, films allow us to do this as we sit in the dark laughing with glee. I loved the music and when Nina Simon burst into song `Feelin' Good' ...it was magic.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[9]]<br/>Rating 8.6 on IMDb I have been anticipating this movie for some time. I cannot believe that M&amp;D each rated it at 3 stars.  I absolutely loved it and will be buying the DVD, when released so I may watch it at will.  Everything about this movie was wonderful and based on a true story made it simply charming.  Having read about the real characters I am truly touched by their story.  Great acting, the whole experience made both my husband and I feel good about humanity and the world. My Earth, Wind and Fire music has bee reprised.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[1]]<br/>God how I loathed this film. Treacly, empty, manipulative drivel. It  is SOOOOOOO shaped to be a feel good experience but its ultimately dishonest. Rich people are boring and uptight and they need a groovy black guy who likes to boogie, smoke pot, assault insulting teenagers, grin like an idiot, and encourage sex to enjoy life. The whole thing is too contrived. And never have you met a quadriplegic who is so little trouble. I wanted to kick Driss during the scene at the opera. <br/>1/2 a star for the cinematography.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[9]]<br/>David and Margaret - 3 stars? Seriously?? Your criticism focuses on two of the funniest scenes in the film. Moreover, surely if anybody is entitled to enjoy mocking the arts and classical music, it's Phillippe. Remember, it's based on a true story!</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[8]]<br/>Come on guys. This is a good film. The performances are great and the film is touching and extremely funny at times but most of all, it is very entertaining and that is why most people go to the cinema; to be entertained. Yes the use of race was cliche but it allows the story/circumstance to be set up quickly and afford more of the films time to what is really important which is their relationship together.<br/><br/>I think you are being overly critical. Just enjoy the movie.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[8]]<br/>Come on M&amp;D lighten up a bit. Movies are supposed to be entertaining and this one sure hits all the right spots. So what if the director is only aiming for the middle bar. Every movie is not about being a masterpiece.The general public like myself are not going to worry about political correctness and as for a warning - I cant believe you said that. I couldn't see anything that would offend me. Maybe I was laughing too much to notice it. Omar Sy was fabulous. Would recommend this film to anyone. Loved it.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Intouchables))[[9]]<br/>Terrific, wonderful, superb. Wonderful performances. Great story made even better by the fact that it is real.  It is not just about being enjoyable or being a feel-good movie.  What we see did happen in real life, with a real paralysed millonaire and a real uneducated man from the parisian gethos.  So, the wider implications and the racial tones are real.  Anyone feels hurt or uneasy about it? Then welcome to real life.  Cinema of this calibre deserves applause.  Terrific.</p>
