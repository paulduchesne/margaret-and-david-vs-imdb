<h2>Kick Ass</h2>
<p class="ratd"> Rated <em>MA</em></p>
<p><em>Review by David Stratton</em></p>
<p>We go from chick flick to fan boy fare with KICK ASS... Dave Lizewski, AARON JOHNSON, is a New York schoolboy who lives with his widowed dad and whose main interests are comic books and beautiful classmate Katie, LYNDSEY FONSECA, who doesn't know he exists. To impress her, Dave orders on-line a wet suit and becomes KICK-ASS, a superhero without powers....<br/><br/>Meanwhile crime boss Frank D'Amico, MARK STRONG, whose son, Chris, CHRISTOPHER MINTZ-PLASSE, is a student at Dave's school, is being threatened by a real superhero, Big Daddy, NICOLAS CAGE, who is training his 11-year-old daughter, Mindy, CHLOE GRACE MORTEZ, to be Hit Girl...<br/><br/>The latest in the seemingly endless line of superhero comic book movies relies more on character than on special effects, and it has a likeable hero in AARON JOHNSON'S diffident teenager. <br/><br/>The screenplay has some sharp comments to make about the meaning of heroics, and MATTHEW VAUGHN, who started out working with Guy Ritchie and who previously made LAYER CAKE and STARDUST, handles it all with confidence. But you have to keep reminding yourself that it's 'only a movie' every time Hit Girl does her stuff- mega-violent action scenes of multiple killings obviously inspired by the early films of John Woo, starring CHOW YUN FAT (Woo is specifically referenced in the dialogue). These scenes are deliberately over-the-top and incredibly violent and the fact that an 11-year-old is doing the killing - shooting and stabbing bad guys - all of whom die very bloodily - will be understandably concerning for many. <br/><br/>Yes, it's only a movie, and an MA-rated one, but were you comfortable with it, Margaret?</p>
<h2>Further comments</h2>
<p>MARGARET: I loved it. <br/><br/>DAVID: Okay, so...<br/><br/>MARGARET: I did not...<br/><br/>DAVID: You didn't have any qualms about it?<br/><br/>MARGARET: Yes, it's confronting but it does go where no film has gone before. You know, an 11 year old who's a very accomplished murderess, and foul mouthed into the bargain. But I think we ought to say to people it is MA rated. Take that rating seriously. Don't let your 11 year olds go to it alone. And they shouldn't be allowed in the cinema anyway. I think this is really refreshing cinema.<br/><br/>DAVID: But why is it refreshing? I mean...<br/><br/>MARGARET: Because it's funny. I think, you're on this rollercoaster ride of ridiculousness but there's a lot of poignancy in here. There's a lot of humour.<br/><br/>DAVID: But don't you think...<br/><br/>MARGARET: ... it's so layered. You know, okay, he becomes a superhero on the net. The girl ends up thinking he's gay, so he goes along with her as the best friend gay boy.<br/><br/>DAVID: Yes, but let's get back to hit girl. <br/><br/>MARGARET: Yes, okay, but there are all these strands in it.<br/><br/>DAVID: I know.<br/><br/>MARGARET: And then you have this 11 year old creature who is sort of like completely, compellingly entertaining and confronting.<br/><br/>DAVID: But, Margaret, can I say something?<br/><br/>MARGARET: No.<br/><br/>DAVID: You say it's fun and on a certain level I guess it is, but don't you think that - I mean, isn't there something a bit disturbing about audiences being asked to have fun with a character of an 11 year old, whether it's a boy or a girl...<br/><br/>MARGARET: Oh, David, what's wrong with you? You know, you've been warned about it. Okay, it's confronting, but there are...<br/><br/>DAVID: Doesn't it say something about society, though, that we find this entertaining?<br/><br/>MARGARET: Well, CLASH OF THE TITANS - that's not bloody?<br/><br/>DAVID: No, it's not the same thing.<br/><br/>MARGARET: This is comic book stuff, too, David.<br/><br/>DAVID: I know it's comic book stuff and as, look...<br/><br/>MARGARET: You're turning into this conservative person.<br/><br/>DAVID: No, I'm only asking the question. I don't know. I don't know the answer to this but I must say it left me quite disturbed.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Well, I think it's confronting and I like being confronted in the cinema and I'm not moralistic about it...<br/><br/>DAVID: Yes, but there's ways of being... <br/><br/>MARGARET: ...and I just hate that.<br/><br/>DAVID: I'm not being moralistic either. I'm just...<br/><br/>MARGARET: I want to be warned about what I'm going to see and if I think I'm going to object, okay, I won't go. But I don't object to very much, so I embraced it and I think it's really, really refreshingly written and I think Aaron Johnson, who played John Lennon in NOWHERE BOY, is really a lovely screen presence.<br/><br/>DAVID: Yes, I think there's a lot of very good things in it.<br/><br/>MARGARET: And she is amazing. She is going to be in the remake of LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, the American version, which is disgusting.<br/><br/>DAVID: Which is going to be horrible, Yes.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Disgusting that it's being made, but good that she's in it. I'm giving this four stars. <br/><br/>DAVID: Yes, I have so many misgivings about this film. I'm giving it two and a half.</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[8]]<br>At first you can't believe what you're seeing and hearing, but then it just rocks and is heaps good.<br><br>Hit-girl is unreal, and the stunts hardcore. This is a great blockbuster with a shocking difference! It's good to be shocked in cinema.. there's no harm in little girl assassins, it's cool fiction and twists what we normally see from violent super-heroes on the screen.<br><br>Such hyper-real scenarios soften the blow of the violence, takes the serious edge off what would otherwise be terrifying, but is actually an entertaining ride.</br></br></br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[1]]<br>Wow. This was simply ridiculous. An 11yo getting shot in the chest by her daddy is not my idea of entertainment. The story is poor and the action is all a bit silly. <br><br>Don't watch this garbage. Go watch The Rock if u want an action flick or Superbad if u want comedy or the Dark Knight for a comic action hero movie... This movie falls somewhere horribly in the middle of those three.<br><br>David you nailed this review with what few words u got in there!</br></br></br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[6]]<br>Initially blown away by Vaughn's superhero/western vision, on a second-viewing Kick-Ass didn't seem to kick that much ass.<br>Sure it's got some fierce action (thanks to Moretz' and Cage's wise-cracking Father and Daughter dup) and a strong villain in Mark Strong (pun very much intended), but when it comes to the crunch, the movie's plot doesn't add up. It seems to be too self-aware when it comes to Aaron Johnson's Kick-Ass (especially in his 'love story'), and having his character as the lead never clicks. It's always about Big Daddy and Hit Girl; so why is Kick-Ass even there?</br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[7]]<br>If you take it for what it's worth, it is simply a good time and an enjoyable film. Hit Girl - I didn't have a problem because it's a character who has grown up in that sort of environment - it can show a lot for a lot of kids and how they are growing up (can be scary) and yes this is not a kids film.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[10]]<br>i loved this movie and to all of those who criticize it of glorifying violence get over it, kick ass is a fun film which is not meant to take all the violence seriously. I also think they go about the violence the right way  and the scene where kick ass gets stabbed helps tell people that things aren't always going to go well when you try to become a superhero.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[8]]<br>Criticising this movie for casting a young actress is like criticising "Taxi Driver" Jodie Foster was also 13 when the movie was filmed and now the movie is an immortal classic, heralded by many critics as one of the best. I think the logic applies here too.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[10]]<br>Coming from a teenage boy who doesnt read comic books and is fully into sport a lot of the negative comments are dissappointing. It was a shock to start off with the fact that there was a 11 year old girl killing everyone but u get used to it. I think though that ppl have focus too much on the girl and not so much on how great the idea of the movie and the movie itself actually is. A gem of a movie</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[4]]<br>This movie is worth a try, very engaging but left me deeply disturbed after the movie. The plot was really out of moon but the movie was visually engaging. 11 yo kid killer did shock me i must admit. If I had a kid, i would have given it 0 star, i mean the level of violence and 11 yo just didn't match. Imagine if your kid turns out to be like one- will you be proud and satisfied and all? i hate myself cuz i kinda enjoyed it, 2 stars.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[10]]<br>Wow, the comments here really reflect how deeply conservative our society is... how hard is it to understand that it is A MOVIE! David most of all should understand this, and judge the movie on how good it is rather than whether it offended him or not. <br><br>This is honestly one of the best films I have seen in a while, I really agree with Margret's comments about how refreshing this film is. Such a feel good film too...<br><br>Looking forward to the sequel. Let's hope it will be at least half as good as its predecessor.</br></br></br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[7]]<br>There is so much to enjoy about this movie, but I find that I in a way agree with both Margaret and David. This is a fun movie, great acting, well thought out, one of the most interesting comic book movies since IRON MAN and THE DARK KNIGHT, but there some moments in this movie which just push it a bit too much... ... and that and the violence just shocked me with its brutality!!! Chloe Mortez, you played the role so well I got worried!!! Listen to the MA classification!!!</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[9]]<br>What a blast, a superhero movie where the main character is no superhero at all. And the show is stolen by Hit-Girl, Cloe Grace Mortez, whose character I found brilliant, and not confronting at all.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[6]]<br>Wasn't offended by this movie just a little let down. Solid beggining lead down by it growing steadily weaker as the film progresses.<br>I think mainly, I expected this film to be fun, that was how it looked and how it began but as the film went on it seemed to steadily take it self more and more seriously.<br/></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[8]]<br>To me, the controversies of Hit Girl, and indeed the second half of the film, were entirely peripheral.  I don't see how an 11-year-old committing extreme violence is more abominable than anyone else of any age doing the same thing.  Regardless, "Hit Girl" is allowed to because she is a character in a work of fiction, and I expect Chloe Grace Mortez would understand that.<br><br>The real appeal was in highlighting the painful disparites between reality and the superhero genre: "Three a*******, laying into one guy while everybody else watches? And you wanna know what's wrong with me?"  That's heroism.</br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[0]]<br>Just watched this movie on DVD. It wasn't what I expected after watching the trailer. I totally agree with David. How can anyone in their right minds think this was entertaining?. This was over the top. Hit Girl shooting people in the head, slicing them up with knives, others getting crushed in cars and blown up in industrial microwaves. I can only imagine those that gave this a high rating are all 30 year old men who still live at home and spend their spare time playing video games, reading comics, and collecting Star Wars memorabilia.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[2]]<br>4 &amp; 1/2 stars to David. 1 &amp; 1/2 stars to Margaret. If this was a Prince Planet film, then it would have been a great fantasy. But as usual, Hollywood portrays it as a reality film, &amp; wants to portray fantasy and reality as the same. This 11 year old girl IS NOT PRINCE PLANET!!!!!!! And this not a cartoon!!! Margaret, do you get it??? Obviously not. The more killings we can get per minute = more entertainment. Isn't that correct????</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[7]]<br>I saw this on a plane, and hence a lot of the swearing and extreme violence was censored.  However, there is no doubt that Hit Girl really stole the show.  Her performance was fabulous.  I very much liked the references to contemporary-non-film culture, e.g. the First Person Shooter scene.<br><br>The other point of concern is that having an 11 year old go in and vindictively massacre all these people is extremely morally dubious.  The world already has a problem with child soldiers - I can't see any good in this portrayal.</br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[7]]<br>I thought the film had it's genuinely funny moments but i couldn't help thinking that it was<br>all too samey. I'm not sure that it wanted to be groundbreaking but alot of people seem to think that it was trying to break-out into something new. I kind of felt that they were trying to make a teen movie that adults could enjoy, but what's a teen movie with-ought the cringe jokes. Just roll over and let Super-bad continue it's victory. Decent but you wont regret missing it.</br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[8]]<br>Kick-Ass is a huge breath of fresh air in the film industry of late and it does one hell of a job capturing your attention. The action sequences are exhilirating and the story is surprisingly interesting. There are some laugh-out-loud moments but I think the film thinks it's funnier than it is. <br><br>The whole cast is great, particularly Cage and Moretz. Not sure what all the controversy is about, it's just as violent as any other MA action movie and the swearing is not out of this world. This is adult entertainment of the highest calibre.</br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[8]]<br>The film plunges us into a world where you think it will follow one path but then it takes another direction. It reminded me of Tarentino's Kill Bill Vol. 1 but still wasn't as good. The violence, as wrong as it was is beautiful to look at and in my opinion people should nutten up, if its an acet to the story then you keep it in.</br></p>

(Hit girl and her father and Chris and his Dad) What is that saying???<br>David is silly! Of course you can have misgivings about it due to the violence and people have different standards and that's fine but why subtract 2 and a half stars for that??? Silly man!</br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[9]]<br>I'm 16 and thought it was excellent, although with Margaret and David I am disappointed.. they didn't discuss it all all or even look at the social commentary it was making. People who don't look past and look further than the violence and swearing are looking at it in a really closed minded, superficial way.. I was disturbed by the violence at all and people are pointing out what that implies about the younger generations, our society etc. Immunity and desensitisation to violence is exactly the point that the film was making through the black humour and satire... <br/></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[10]]<br>I would gladly give Kick-Ass 100 out of 5, if it were permitted.  Absolutely brilliant.  Crude yes, violent yes, funny, very bloody so, but the only thing that sort of disturbed me, was HitGirl's exquisite use of the C-word, not disturbed as such, shocked. <br>The violence was exquisite as well, not overly gratuitous, just perfect and in context.<br>One question though.  Wouldn't a bazooka shell tear a bloke apart, instead of just ferrying him through the sky only to explode once it hit a solid object?<br>Words almost fail me in just how sensational this movie is.  And I'm 52.</br></br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[4]]<br>Like jeeren said, the lack of story was the most bothersome thing about this movie. The violence was far milder than I'd read about or expected (far from the "hard R" that it was labelled in the US). It was entertaining, but not anything special. The cast did their best with the weak material and thinly-written characters. And it already seems dated with its use of MySpace (MySpace??) as an Internet device.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[10]]<br>This is a film where I don't believe 'comic fanboy' can be classified for the success of the film. It does take the characters and basic ideas from the Comic but it drastically changes the themes and outcomes of the main plot. The comic... was terrible. If you did enjoy the film DO NOT read the comic, in many ways if the original idea was what the writer intended the film suffers. I am just glad this film stands on its own and is something I hope will continue. A 'better than the comic' movie adaption.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[5]]<br>I had an epically gross misunderstanding of what kind of movie I walked into. Judging from the trailer and the marketing I was expecting slapstick humour based on the premise of "What would happen if you tried to be a superhero". <br>Instead you get this confusing semi serious superhero movie where the humour is kinda weak. McLovin was wasn't lovable or funny and the violence feels like a bit of a gimmick. It has it's moments but comparing it to the quality of The Watchmen which delivers an intelligent storyline, it fails on many levels like David said.</br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[9]]<br>One of the things which many people seem to have missed is that all the young people in the film were incredibly influenced by the adult/care givers in their lives. All the violence in the film actually stems from adult influences over the kids (eg Hit Girl, Chris D'Amico) and the kids' desire to emulate a parent. My impression was that the film was also making a comment on this, rather than trying to depict intrinsically violent children. Great film!</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[9]]<br>Definately not a movie for kids - but I had a fantastic time watching this movie as a 20-something year old. While it does speak volumes about how we're becoming desensitized to violence, I thought kick-ass at its heart was a roller-coaster ride full of comic-book superheroes and villains. Don't let your kids see this one - I saw a 12 year old in the cinema covering his eyes - but if you're a uni student and looking for a fun way to spend $8 - this is a great bet. Awesome!</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[8]]<br/>It astounds me that people who are so concerned about violence in this film involving an 11 year old female character, but in some parts of the world, children much younger are forced to pick up guns and fight or are really living in terrible conditions.  Why are we getting so worked up about this piece of fictional entertainment.  Some people need a real sense of perspective and need to get worked up about truly serious issues rather than get worked up about a piece of popular entertainment.  Oh, and its a great film.

Also there's movies like battle royale.<br/><br/>People are making out that Hitgirl goes around dropping the C bomb left right and centre, and it's not nearly as bad as the wowzers make it out to be. MA is an appropriate rating, there isn't huge sprays of blood and gore like kill bill has, which is rated R. Language is strong but not OTT.<br/><br/>Parents should really try parenting instead of wanting things banned or restricted heavily.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[9]]<br/>Saw the film and loved it, and I'm not even a fan of fantasy/action/superhero films. Hit Girl was an amazing character and I found the film much more uplifting than some  other films out there, eg "The Lovely Bones", "Precious".  Also, as one reviewer in the Daily Telegraph said, Hit Girl far outstrips the Olsen twins as a role model.</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[9]]<br/>I watch ALOT of movies! So it's difficult for a film to surprise and shocked me these days while still enjoying that feeling. <br/>I felt confronted, moralistic and to be perfectly honest some things in this film do seem and feel just plain wrong. But oh so right too! I was thouroughly entertained, laughed out aloud frequently, was on the edge of my seat with alot of the action sequences and even the suspense all the while this film expresses it doesn't want to be taken seriously, just kick some ass and boy it does that well! Electrifying, Brilliant!</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[9]]<br/>Fantastic. The most fun I've had at the movies this year. In fact, very few films from last year beat it as well. The music is fantastic, the action is intense, the pacing is fast, the characters are all well drawn out and the writing is fantastically funny when it wants to be. In conclusion, I agree with Margaret on this one. Kick ass is fun :D Loved what Nick Cage did with the character of Big Daddy. Listen to the way he talks. Holy Jumping Sharks Batman!</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[10]]<br/>I'm not the biggest comic book/film fan, but this film is different. I agree with Margaret, it is refreshing cinema. And, moreso - it's ENTERTAINING. Which is precisely what movies are made for, entertainment. You cannot doubt or deny the talent on offer here. I've never seen anything like it, and enjoyed it more than any spiderman film that's been offered over the years.</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[9]]<br/>Awesome film. One that I enjoyed much more than I thought possible. Aaron Johnson' fantastic as Kick Ass and Chloe Moretz is sublime as Hit Girl.<br/>The controversy concerning killings by an 11 year old are concerning if kids are watching as far as I'm concerned - and its the responsibility of parents to control that.Interests me that a pyscho can torture women to the point of torture porn in Wolf Creek and not much gets said, but a kid can kill the bad guys (less sadistically in terms of her enjoyment) and the world goes into a censorship frenzy.</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[3]]<br/>I wasn't prepared for at least 2 scenes in the movie of completely senseless and disturbing violence.<br/>One - a man is crushed to death in a car crusher - you hear him scream and everything - is this supposed to be funny? And two- another man is 'exploded' inside an industrial microwave. <br/><br/>I know I have seen a lot worse but I didn't expect this sort of horror. What has happened to the comic book film genre? This was in seriously bad taste. And it seems to be getting worse...it's all about context isn't it?</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[8]]<br/>As a mature woman I found the first bit of the movie quite boring, typical American teen humor. And then, bam, in she comes. That made me sit up.  I haven't laughed so much in ages.  I don't think the foul language disturbing or the violence.  It was a black comedy and should be taken as such.  Chloe is an young actor and was acting.  How old was Jodie Foster playing a prostitue in Taxi Driver!.  I agree with Margaret about "Let the Right One In". I read the  book.</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[6]]<br/>This movie is either seriously overrated or the majority of the people watching this easily enjoy poor arts&amp; films. At most the movie is mildly entertaining and definitely not revolutionary.   <br/>People saying this has something new to offer to the superhero genre are really being disrespectful to many concepts. And, in my opinion, the superhero thing was really just for some cheesy humour.</p>

But because it is almost exactly the same as an idea that I've had to explore for some time now. What if someone REALLY normal (not Bruce Wayne normal) suited up to become a masked vigilante?<br/>Well I went to watch it with those conflicting emotions and spent the next couple of hours laughing my head off, gasping in shock and generally appreciating an excellent story, brilliantly told.</p>

It has something for everyone, action sequences that will have you on the edge of your seat, witty dialogue that will have you laughing out loud, and an emotional punch that will keep this film in your mind long after you have left the cinema. The reason i loved this movie was because i cared about the characters, and the performances were all delightful to watch. I was not disturbed at all by hit girl for the simple reason that i loved her charecter too much to resent her actions.</p>

I'd place Kick Ass  second to (Nolan's) Batman films, Ironman, &amp; (Lee's) Hulk.  A guilty pleasure for comic book fans &amp; films goers alike.  For the record, Hitgirl's swearing is not as frequent as it's made out to be.</p>

An 11yr old girl killing men is empowering to women because girls can do anything! Its symbolic and metaphorical, im disturbed that parent groups would waste time complaing about this -because they should have something better to do, great movie great music, funny dialogue, i see a movie i want blood and nudity --BUT also philosophical ideas deconstruct mythos of characters, watchmen is also for me &amp; inglorious basterds!,</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[6]]<br/>This film wasn't too my taste, but I am more so disturbed by those people who found this film funny or exciting<br/><br/>The characters weren't superheroes at all. They were vigilante psychopaths who place no value or regard on the sanctity of human life.</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[7]]<br/>This was a very good film but i still came out of the cinema annoyed becasue i believe it could have been so much better. This film could not decide whether it was for 8 year old children or young adults. The action scenes were brillient and it definately had few good laughs in it but so of the jokes in this made me cringe, like a was embarrassed to be in the cinema. This film could have been brillient if they had taken out all the kiddy humour and just stuck with the more serious plot of the movie.</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[10]]<br/>i dont know why people are against the whole 11 year old girl thing i thought it was great for a change to see and 11 year old dominate hands down dominate this is a classic movie which i would watch again and again and yes it might be confronting in the fact that you might not be expecting to see it but you dont go to the movies to have something youve expected to see shown just cause its a superhero movie doesnt mean its appropriate for little kids to see its not its violent and bloody</p>

Forget the rubbish/'concerned' reviews, this movie is a masterpiece, and does not take itself as seriously as some of the moral superiors clearly do.  Brilliant acting, direction, clever lines, very unexpected!  But probably not for those with very weak stomachs.<br/><br/>Thank goodness a studio bought this movie!</p>

Personally I find them more offensive and I am not a horror/killer fan. I would think SAW is more disturbing than this.<br/><br/>This is just FUNNY. If you knew anything about the CIA you'd know they do far worse thing with children in real life. Look up "trauma based mind control".</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[7]]<br/>On face value, I read it as a work of hyperbole in confronting the tendencies (American) society exhibits. I can understand the shocking nature of the film in depicting ONE pre-pubescent child being a crazy killer but she's not heartless. The justifications she had for what she does are convincing. <br/><br/>The entertainment value is not worth passing up. At the end of the day it is a work of fiction; and it is essentially a (postmodern) satire on the superhero genre of film appropriating comic book fantasy (Kick Ass is in fact, a comic after all).<br/><br/>A very clever film!</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[8]]<br/>I take David's point about an 11 year old and the extreme violence.  I think when he asks what it says about our society that we are aked to see this as entertainment he has unknowingly hit the nail on the head.  Big Daddy and Hit Girl are clearly parodies of Batman and Robin.  Part of the premise of the film is to show how 'real-world' heroes would work.  We have accepted Batman's training of a young child in ultra-violence for decades - Kickass merely comments on our acceptance of that fact.  David's reaction is exactly the reaction striven for.</p>

There were some great scenes, some funny moments and the soundtrack was fun too, seriously people, relax.<br/><br/>Its rated MA for a reason, so parents are warned, i see no other issue.

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[10]]<br/>I'm not the age group this film is aimed at (50 year old female) but I loved it too. Yes, it was confronting to see a little girl killing and swearing, but after the initial shock it was hilarious. It was the contrast against expectations that made it so funny. <br/>Anyone remember the cute little bunny in Monty Python's Holy Grail? Or the Monty Python scene around the piano, blood gushing everywhere when they chopped people's body parts off? <br/>We were rolling on the floor laughing then and I was rolling on the floor laughing now.</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[7]]<br/>I'm more in Margaret's camp than David's for this one, I found the comic ride to be rather enjoyable. <br/><br/>I do concede David's very valid points however. Are we as a society so desensitised to violence and sex that we can watch an 11-year-old behave this way and find it charming and funny? It will be 5 years before the child star is even old enough to watch her performance. Is that a positive thing?<br/><br/>I can say categorically however, that I'd have given this film 5 stars as an 18-year-old, which appears to be the target demographic.</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[4]]<br/>Quite a bit of fun (I think) but very patchy. The film veers between being a fun comedy about nerdy superheroes and it's also an ultra violent shoot-em-up (and slash-em-up). Was pretty dull in the end due to its somewhat unfocused and muddled mix of content. It got too caught up in the pyrotechnics of carnage. Messy and really poor acting in places ('Red Mist' in particular).<br/></p>

The story wasn't strong, although performances were of high quality.<br/><br/>I felt a little uncomfortable watching a young girl take joy in inflicting and receiving pain.  I just felt that side of the movie was over-done, with no subtlety, and crossed a moral line.  I'm far from conservative, and don't have a problem with violence in cinema, but this seemed pointless.</p>

But the discussion of the ridiculous ratings sytem in this country is best left for another forum, I guess.<br/><br/>Anybody complaining about this without having seen it, is a moron: plain &amp; simple.

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[2]]<br/>Immunity to violence in movies is nothing to be proud of MARGARET. Kick Ass is way Too Much! I would never let my teenage sons see this movie. I watched Kick Ass to see what is being delivered and where the influences come from to use knives in youth culture these days. Not all will be influenced in a negative way but you can be sure that a few will become more violent by pure osmosis from absorbing this movie. Margaret's approval is irresponsible parenting...perhaps her children are adults now but mine and many are not. David is The Man.</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[8]]<br/>I'm with Margaret on this one. This is a cracker of a movie and IMHO a pending cult classic. As for David - A friend at work commented that "in life you start off small and with one tooth, and you finish life the same way - only a great deal more cynical" :) This was a great tongue-in-cheek romp - to me the shocks/violence were ultimately pretty good fun and not all that confronting. The characters were likable. The undertones of a cowardly society were pretty poignant. Bottom line: Even my wife liked it and she's into chick-flicks!</p>

(Like Terminator 2's risible anti-violence message.)<br/><br/>And if it were a young boy committing these violent acts I would not be any less impressed.<br/><br/>David at least has seen beyond the hipness of the piece.God forbid, any censor stop Margaret seeing what Margaret wants to see.<br/></p>

You can afford to be confronted but it's not your child being bullied or killed with a knife in school, or your male child copying your domestic violence. The pitch &amp; colour of this movie points to an age groups below the rating and the kids will watch and copy!</p>

KICK ASS contributes to  further the osmosis of violence within certain people on our streets, .

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[6]]<br/>I think this movie should be renamed 'Dumb Ass'. I didn't find the main character lovable, or poignant at all. I was constantly frustrated by his incompetence, naivete and overall wussy character. It made me want to kick his ass.<br/><br/>On the other hand the father daughter combination was very nicely done, a great mixture between adorable cute and ruthless killer. Also the relationship between the crime boss and his son was very fun to watch.<br/><br/>If it wasn't for the dumbass main character I would give this film a 5/5</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[10]]<br/>Great film! Very entertaining. <br/><br/>I find society's view on violence interesting. An 11 yo killing machine? What is all the hype? Better than an 11yo being murdered, or raped, or kidnaped...which has been portrayed on the big screen before and nobody complains. Go and watch 'Precious', then you will know what is distrubing (child abuse, child neglect, rape, incest, even the degrading a down syndrome child!! etc.....and it wins an Academy award). Precious was challenging but a good movie. Kick-Ass was simple good fun and NOT REAL PEOPLE. <br/></p>

If you play any kind of video games, you'll soon find little girls wielding giant axes, little girls burning people alive, little girls with chainsaws, etc.<br/><br/>In the movie, a little girl was able to take down the entire evil corporation fueled with nothing more than sheer willpower.  <br/><br/>Also, you can tell when a movie is made with care and love.

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[9]]<br/>David, David, David...I'm normally more aligned with your viewpoint than Margaret's, but I think you've got it very wrong on this one. I'm amazed that anyone could take the violence in this movie seriously - it's deliberately OTT comic book style and not in the same league as more subtle, but realistic (and therefore disturbing) violence portrayed in many other movies. As with views about video games making people violent, some people really underestimate the ability of the mind to separate reality from fantasy.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie is brilliant - an absolute crack-up that even got a Canberra audience laughing!</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[10]]<br/>This is one of the greatest films I have ever seen in the past year or so. Why? Predominantly because it seems the creators did focus a lot of their time on the cleverness and creativity of the storyline - rather than the special effects. And the fact that there is an 11 year old girl, I have not a clue as to how this may be disturbing... Please tell me? If you are not a fan of this category in movies, then don't go and watch it.</p>

Her character has a defined role and character, and it is executed superbly.<br/><br/>Yes, it is a little confronting, but since when has confronting been a bad thing?

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[8]]<br/>I agree with Linkage Axye. This film is based more on a satire of superheroes. I enjoyed the film, based more on the strong characture and hidden plot. The film however is a double edged sword, when people take it literally it will <br/>become a strong influence on kids acting violently. Throughly enjoyed it (looking past the violence)</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[4]]<br/>Before casual readers scan my score and move on, yes, I have seen the film. <br/><br/>This film is probably deserving of more stars than I give it; it is very competently directed, occasionally stylistically interesting, tightly scripted and contains a number of above average performances. But...<br/><br/>Even if it is 'clever' (although I'm not sure how, with its 'have your cake and eat it too' hyper-violence with a wink, it could ever be called 'refreshing'), any real lover of the superhero narrative knows that there are people who appreciate intellect at the cost of moral tunnel-vision.<br/><br/>They're called the villains.</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[0]]<br/>Margaret, you did not let David give his opinion or frankly get a word in edge ways. I am very disappointed. There are two people on the show for a reason. It was a valid thought. David never said it represented real life but I can see why he felt uneasy while watching it. The film is not the issue the rating is. MA is not suitable for this film. Anyone that thinks it is ok for even a 15yr old or younger to watch this shows how much we are desensitising or youth to unsuitable adult topics.</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[10]]<br/>One of the most enjoyable movies I have seen in years.  <br/><br/>Most peoples reservations with it are over the portrayal of the Hit Girl character.  If you can get past the moral objections of using a a pre-teen actor in a role that kills and swears, you will likely love the movie.  If not don't go and see it. It is MA15+ for a good reason.</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[2]]<br/>Margaret, one doesn't have to be 'moralistic' to make a moral judgment.  Your sneer that 'you've been warned' by the rating is facile.  I doubt you'd feel the same about a film promoting violence towards Muslims.  And tell me, how does the use of a real 11 year old girl as a staggeringly violent, foul-mouthed avenger not constitute child abuse?  Your knee-jerk civil libertarian stance is simply intellectual sloppiness, though I suppose the author of this comment will be dismissed as a moralistic wowser.  Much easier than critical reflection, isn't it?</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[7]]<br/>This was quite a good original film as opposed to a lot of the other superhero films with teenagers the heroes. The lady Chloe Grace who plays Miss Hit is very good in her role as is Aaron Johnson as Kick Ass. The main villain Frank played by  Mark Strong is excellent in his role. <br/>The film has some good action scenes especially towards the end.</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[7]]<br/>saw the movie and i liked it,it is refreshing to watch a bit of a change in comic book turn films. In regard to the 11 year old girl i was fine with it.I do admit it was a bit confronting but also i have thought a lot about our moralistic hypocrisy. We see films with adults doing this sort of stuff all the time. I'm sorry  if we condone these sort of movies with adults its natural that things change to include younger people. film is fantasy,an escape from reality and not to be taken too seriously</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[3]]<br/>Beyond the issue of the Hit Girl character, this movie was just badly made. Flabby dialogue, awkward pacing, terrible plot, paint-by-numbers characters and bad performances (but also a couple of good ones). I guess the formula is just to pump up the violence, then throw in some profanities and frank sex talk, and boom, you've got a hit with today's overstimulated audiences. I think Margaret's just a sucker for controversy. By the way, I'm 21 years old and in no way a conservative.</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[0]]<br/>I find it disturbing that as a society we are saying that these behaviours are acceptable and entertaining. The arguement about being a comic book is rubbish and an excuse. How would people feel if this 11 year old girl was simulating sexual acts on screen?  I seriously question the parents of the actress who are happy for their daughter to say this is ok. <br/>If this is indeed from a comic book it is even more disturbing that soemone actually thought it "cool" to dream up such a character and put her to print.</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[8]]<br/>David, the film is based on a comic book and is not meant to be a dramatic representation of real life relationships - it's fantasy, woven with all the complex (and often disturbing) elements of the human psyche. I thought it was cleverly stylised, multi-layered, and at times rib crackingly funny. If morals and ethics do come into it, scratch beneath the blood and gore and what we find is really quite a poignant take on father-daughter relationships, albeit on a hyper, superhero level.</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[9]]<br/>This is a response to "Concerned Person". If you are going to critique a film then do it. Do not abuse someone for their opinion. I think this film was amazing in many ways. And not because I'm a brainwashed lefty. It seems you didn't think Hostel 2 was enough to write about but THAT was an extraordinarily average piece of work. This should be taken of face value (which is brilliant, and yes very violent) but should be loved because of what is happening underneath the surface which you would see if you looked harder. Please watch again.</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[10]]<br/>The movie itself is fantastic. It's not a kids movie at all. Not by a long shot.<br/><br/>I have read both the comic book, and saw the film several weeks before release. I do not understand the sexist and ageist scandal surrounding the film.<br/><br/>If it was a small boy doing the killing and swearing, there wouldn't be any comment. But because it's a girl, there is.<br/><br/>Don't you see the point here? Hit-Girl takes the stereotype of a girl being sweet and innocent and shatters it, while at the same time showing that a girl can do anything.<br/><br/>Best movie ever.<br/><br/><br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[10]]<br/>I'm honestly more disgusted by the reactions here then the movie itself. Everyone commenting here about the morality of hit girl that hasn't seen the film should be ashamed. At least David's conservatism was informed and reasonably reasoned whereas this lot of reactionary Wilkin-ites are simply looking for the latest thing to chastise and belittle, to bully, in order to feel big. Go to the US and join the Republican party already, we certainly don't want you here around out impressionable youth.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, it is quite simply a phenomenological playground and fantastic fun.</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[9]]<br/>I just got back from seeing Kick-Ass and I absolutely loved it - yes, it was incredibly violent with language to match (definitely don't take the kids to this one) but it was so refreshingly different from the other cliched and predictable superhero movies that have been doing the rounds lately.  Both Vaughn and the case were in top form, and Nic Cage hasn't done anything this good in a long time!<br/><br/>And for David and the other reactionary conservatives out there; grow up, seriously.  Violence is violence, regardless of who is committing the act,</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[9]]<br/>Yes, this violent character is challenging, but isn't cinema supposed to be? Is confronting cinema directed entirely at the arthouse crowd? Can't a Hollywood movie challenge society's expectations. Surely we can get past the belief that all blockbuster movie characters have to be role models. <br/>Is the character very violent? Yes. Will this encourage other 11-year-old girls to attack groups of gangsters with swords and guns? If you think it will, you're an idiot.</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[10]]<br/>This film is not a typical Super-hero film, it's more of a realistic look at what super-heroism would be like within the context of reality. That is, people get hurt, people die and the people who put away the bad guys are closer to sociopaths themselves. The message in this film is clear and I'm sure that the director was filming more than just the movie itself, but rather the entire audience. It's like he wanted to see humanity laugh at disgusting portrayals of mass-murder. Although it is certainly an entertaining piece it's also rather fun to think about.</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[9]]<br/>The most disappointing thing so far about the negative comments here concerning the movie is... I bet none of those people have actually seen it yet. Or will even bother to. Not everybody has to like this kind of movie but a little basic knowledge would be nice before you start complaining about it. The hysteria I've seen over the last 24 hours has been ridiculous!  Yes, this is brutal and bloody, but the whole movie's done in such a farcical and comedic style that all the wailing and gnashing of teeth is completely unwarranted.</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[8]]<br/>I think somewhere along the line, many reviewers (and the people raising all the controversy) have failed to realise that the movie is making a point that violence and behaviour from someone at such an age is outrageous... far from condoning or encouraging it. I love how in every news article about the film in the last few days has mentioned the 'Dad shoots at daughter' scene, but neglected to mention that it is shown with the intention of making people react with 'What the heck?!'. Great movie, loads of fun. Highly recommended!</p>

She's part of an elitist lefitist liberal culture that has been brainwashed and can't see the damaging influences video games and violent rubbish movies are having on our disensitized kids who beat up on each other in a brainwashed violent Hollywood culture. Kubrick withdrew CLOCKWORK ORANGE from circulation  because of rapes, murders linked to that film. Pomeranz should get a real job and stop being a bludger.

All of the performances (with the possible exception of Mintz-Plasse) are great, and Nicolas Cage is surprisingly very good. I can see where David is coming from (on the show last night), but I'm surprised by his ultra-conservatism here - yes, seeing an 11 year-old slaughter 40 or 50 bad guys is certainly unusual, but, taken in the context of this kind of film, nowhere near as disturbing as he makes out.</p>

<p class="comment">((Kick Ass))[[10]]<br/>SPOILER WARNING.<br/>David I think I may have an answer for you on the purpose of Hit Girl.<br/>While one of the main themes of the film is about those who see a crime and do nothing (leading to the creation of Kick Ass), Hit Girl plays as the other end of the scale of going to far. At what point does Big Daddy's obsession with revenge reach it's limit if he is willing to manipulate his own daughter, making it a game and creating comics of the villains? This was clear in the conversation with his old partner. Amazing-film.</p>
