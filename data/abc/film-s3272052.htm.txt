<h2>Red Dog</h2>
<p class="ratd"> Rated <em>PG</em></p>
<p><em>Review by David Stratton</em></p>
<p>Tom, LUKE FORD, arrives at Dampier, centre of a huge mining operation in Australia's north-west. He discovers that a dog is sick and may have to be put down, but he can't understand why everyone's so concerned about it. The locals, including barman Jack, NOAH TAYLOR, tell him the story of the dog - how it was first seen some years earlier, how it hitched rides with people it liked and how it eventually attached itself to an American, John Grant, JOSH LUCAS, who soon after fell in love with Nancy, RACHAEL TAYLOR, who worked as a secretary for the mining company.<br/><br/>Initial misgivings about a film partly financed by mining giant Rio Tinto, and which therefore not surprisingly presents a very glowing view of a mining community in the Top End, soon evaporate thanks to the genuineness of this emotion-charged story of a dog that wormed its way into the hearts of a great many people - the fact that this is based on a true story makes it all the better. The dog itself, played by a woofer named Koko, is a great central character, and the humans are good value, too. <br/><br/>It was a lovely idea to cast LOENE CARMEN as Jack, the barman's partner, given that Carmen and Noah Taylor co-starred back in 1987 in the classic Australian film, THE YEAR MY VOICE BROKE, and it's also great to see the late BILL HUNTER in a small part. Terrific, too, are Arthur Angel, as an Italian from Abruzzi, and Keisha <br/>Castle-Hughes as the nurse with whom he falls in love. But, apart from Koko himself, the star of the film is Dampier and the area around it, which has been lovingly photographed by Geoffrey Hall. <br/><br/>I was very disappointed by director Kriv Stenders' last film, LUCKY COUNTRY, but RED DOG makes up for it - it's hugely entertaining.</p>
<h2>Further comments</h2>
<p>DAVID: Margaret?<br/><br/>MARGARET: It is indeed a lovely Australian film and I've been ranting and raving lately about Australians not going to Australian films...<br/><br/>DAVID: You have.<br/><br/>MARGARET: ...and if they don't go to this one there's something very wrong, because this is so lovely. It celebrates the Australian spirit in a really beautiful way. It's funny. It's moving. I hate to tell you, I bawled my eyes out at the end of it and, it's sort of like, okay, you react against going to certain Australian films. Don't react against this one. This is lovely. It will pay off for everybody what you want from a movie. You want to be moved. You want to be entertained. You want to laugh. You've going to get all of that in this, and the dog is a winner. He's gorgeous.<br/><br/>DAVID: He is. And it's a film in the tradition of films that have, in the past, been very, very popular. Films like GREYFRIARS BOBBY and LASSIE COME HOME, films about the loyalty of dogs for their masters, which is a wonderful theme, I think. <br/><br/>MARGARET: But also that lovely laconic, individualistic spirit of...<br/><br/>DAVID: Of the dog?<br/><br/>MARGARET: ... this melting pot of Australia, and taking the piss like blokes do. There's something very celebratory about this film that I really, really responded to.<br/><br/>DAVID: Me too. I liked it. It's just a pity it didn't get screenings during school holidays, because it's a film the whole family could go and see and enjoy and they should.<br/><br/>MARGARET: It's absolutely a family film. <br/><br/>DAVID: Yes. Yes.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Look, I'm giving it four stars. I liked it so much.<br/><br/>DAVID: I loved it. I'm giving it four and a half.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br>Frankly, if you don't bawl your eyes out watching this you are sub-human. Some cliches for sure, just like The Truman Show and Gladiator, which are totally different films to this but the only ones that make me cry every time. I seriously think people that don't get moved by these films are psychopathic.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[8]]<br>I'm a sucker for movies like this. i bawled my eyes out in Marley and Me, and Red Dog was no different. this movie was so personal, as i used to live up north, and had a kelpie that died after 13 years of being a great mate. this film is the definition of 'Man's Best Friend'</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[1]]<br>Is this the most polarising film D&amp;M have ever reviewed?<br>For me it was a half star - for scenery. Every gag and plot move was obvious. You think "Surely they won't make that cliched obvious choice..." - but then they do.<br>Really painful to sit through to the end. I have to agree with every criticism that's been raised below.<br>People have a right to enjoy whatever they like - and that includes David and Margaret - but this clumsy film falls so far short of their usual standards it's hard to understand how they could enjoy it as they have.</br></br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[10]]<br>Every now and again you see a film that has a clever charming story which has a mesmerising effect as soon as it starts so it has a ring of brilliance about it. You can see that the cinematography in Red Dog is perfect. <br><br>One of the best films to come out of Australia in many years.  Tells the story of a one in a million dog who affected many.</br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br>The first 10 minutes I thought another cringe,hollywood cliched film..then that beautiful Red (Koko) took over the screen and the film began to shine..It is a feel good movie..unapologetic in its sentimentality..if you did not shed tears you are certainly hard hearted..As a dog lover I was saddened to hear the passing of Koko..but he lives on in this beautiful film..!</br></p>

The dog is amazing (RIP, Koko), the story is engaging, the actors are competent (yes, they are over-the-top, but it's forgiveable).  I laughed, I cried, I cringed, I laughed again, and then cried again.  <br><br>Red Dog was everything I wanted out of a movie.  Definitely a favourite of mine.</br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br>Fab movie. Yes it's corny, cheesy and at times poorly acted but seriously; we were all that in the 70's. According to my dad - who worked in a camp that's how it really was! This was about people telling "their story" of how they remembered / knew red dog + his impact on them. Of cause embellished for movie land but that's to be expected! Country beautiful, soundtrack great, Koko gorgeous. I enjoyed it much much more than expected. I'm not sure why people disliked it so much - it was a hit in our household.<br><br>MODERATOR<br>And sadly Koko passed away last week from heart failure - at only 7 years old.</br></br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br>Red Dog was a film in 2011 who was directed by Kriv Stenders. It was based on a mining operation in Dampier, Australia's North-West. Red Dog, KOKO, was based on a true story. The film was made to the story as close as possible. Red Dog was about how one dog hitches rides from many different people, and then soon found its true master, John Grant, JOSH LUCAS, who worked as driver for the miners. Nancy, RACHEL TAYLOR, who works as a secretary on the mining operation, she finds John and fell in love. I recommend it to anyone.<br><br/></br></br></p>

Red Dog starts of when Koko who plays Red Dog finds Dampier during his travels by himself. He starts to like the mining men but he attaches himself to one and one only john Grant played by Josh Lucas. Red Dog is a very good Australian movie that show the Australian outback very well and also show the loyalty and love dogs have to there owners.

To make sure he had millions of viewers Kriv made a star line up with Josh Lucas playing red dogs only ever master and Rachel Taylor in the role of Nancy who comes into the town expecting everything her way, then she met John. Koko who plays Red Dog is what this film is based about as it follows Red when he goes somewhere, who he goes with and why he goes there.<br/>I recommend this movie for every one anywhere.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br/>In my opinion I thought this movie was made, to show to people the history of the Australian culture and the heroes who made the town of Dampier a proud place to be. It was a truly wonderful film. I thought the film really touched people to know  that one little dog searched around the world to find his master John. The film displayed team work as a community, for example Nancy and Miners search for Red Dog. To conclude I thought the film really touched peoples hearts, displaying a close relationship between a dog and the community of Dampier.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[1]]<br/>One of the worst Aussie films I've seen and I really wanted to enjoy it. My husband didn't believe it could be that bad and when it came on pay tv he was keen to watch it. After 10 minutes he couldn't bear any more of it and switched it off. Puerile "humour", extreme overacting and weak dumbed-down dialogue. Embarrassing and cringeworthy. When can Australian film return to making quality films like Lantana?</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[2]]<br/>What can I say?  Having moved from Sydney 4 years ago back to Europe, was really looking forward to a good Aussie film.  Sadly, this wasn't it.  Contrived, over-acted, insincere - from the beginning, it didn't ring true and it never improved. I nearly cried at the end, but not out of sadness, more like boredom. D&amp;M should know better - think The Castle, Jindabyne, Lantana, The Dish - any number of films that were thrilling, funny, real - not this bunch of caricatures in the outback.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br/>A great film for animal lovers! The main point of the film was the relationship between the dog and the humans in a specific Western Australian mining community. As for other themes?  The dog may not have been an Aboriginal story, and an Aboriginal story about the Pilbara in the 70's would probably be a vastly different film.  I doubt any film can be totally representative of all Australia. "Eye of the Storm" (for example) mainly portrayed aspirational and wealthy toffs, but I'm sure  Patrick White knew South East Sydney was more diverse than that.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br/>What an absolutely beautiful movie. I agree with Margaret and David's rating. It was great. There are a few comments below that seem to think this movie was missing various political agendas. Does every movie ever made really need to have one? This was beautifully cast. The animals were gorgeous and the actors fabulous. It had a really good story line and it will become a family favorite for sure. I cried my eyes out.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[10]]<br/>Guaranteed to bring tears to anyone who has a heart towards animals (NOT Godfrey or KevinC (see comments below). This film presents the background of an urban legend in color and creativity. The only thing I dislike is the what's-their-name-trailer-park-owners-who-aren't-worth-spitting-on. To see that they would shoot a dog as beautiful as Red Dog is just disgraceful. That doesnt lower my rating towards it, though. Overall, it was a wonderful movie about a wonderful dog, who travels all over Australia and even Japan, all to find the owner he loves. "Sometimes, you pick your dog. Other times, your dog picks you."</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[0]]<br/>What a terrible, mindless, boring and embarrassing film.<br/><br/>The script read like it was conceived and completed in an afternoon. The "Italian" emulated the accent so poorly it was difficult to believe. Talk about whitewashing the Pilbara; I saw one Aboriginal person in the whole film. He was an extra in one of the final scenes.<br/><br/>Did the mining companies who contributed to funding this have some some sort of editorial control? It seemed like an public relations campaign for them.<br/><br/>I love animals and good love stories, but this was a waste of time.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[0]]<br/>I've owned a Red Kelpie.<br/><br/>This dog looked more show dog  than the Kelpie X Cattle Dog of the legend. His lustrous shampoo advertisement coat and over-weight body did nothing for his role as an outback hustler, who should have been lean with a canny attitude and a coat in need of a good wash and a flea treatment.<br/><br/>His scenes with Red Cat were particularly disturbing. On no occasion did he bare a genuine fang, or show any real dog aggression. This was true throughout the film,<br/><br/>Koko is a lovely dog, but he was a poor choice for this role.<br/></p>

He is not the guy whose wife and child were killed in a motor accident. There are plenty of newspaper articles around to show the relationship my Uncle had with Red Dog and what he did when Red Dog Died.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[1]]<br/>I feel like one of the only people that didn't like this film. I didn't find the characters particularly likeable, and many of them seemed like poorly written caricatures of what I can only assume that a foreigner might think a typical Aussie is like. I found the performances overacted and unconvincing. The story itself had a lot of potential but I was very disappointed in it and didn't even make it through the whole film before I lost interest.</p>

Anyone who could possibly say something horrible against this film is really being quite stupid! However, to be fair you would DEFINITELY have to be a true Australian to really understand and be captivated by this film.

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[8]]<br/>One more thing haters, Red Dog was written by an American, not Australian. I have to admit, i don't know if Australia was a lot like the movie in the 1970s but if it is not, blame the American writer who think it's ok to write the stereotypes and cliches in it. That goes the same for A Few Best Men, that was written by a British man, not an Australian.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[2]]<br/>Aussies seem a bit vulnerable to easy persuasion. Many believe Andrew Bolt, Alan Jones and co. on climate change, and many believe the hype that this is a good film. It's not. People keep saying 'it's hilarious', but seem unable to quote a line or scene to support their claim. I watched it at home and my daughter wandered off mid-way through. Like its opening scene of the much loved Red Dog about to be humanely put down by gun in a pub pool room of all places, or its American lead actor, it lacks credibility, authenticity and more.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[1]]<br/>I'm figuring M &amp; D are simply demonstrating support for the Oz film industry, perhaps even for veteran Noah Taylor, by highly rating this shocker.  This movie for the dim-witted was made purely for the mass market,  like so much other crap.  If it was American, odds are that D &amp; M would not have chosen to even see it.  What has always disturbed me is that so many people are so not discerning.   Just fart - no worries.  Please movie goers, develop your film viewing palate so films as base as this can't keep filling our cinemas.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[10]]<br/>I think the success of the film speaks for itself - achieved from many different quarters, which I think is the sign of a great film. Depictions of Australian culture can always be healthily debated. However, the film is unique for its portrayal of humans' love for their animals, and vice versa. If I ask a person on the street if their dog is a Red Dog - well, they all know who  Red Dog is now. A handful of bitter audience reviews are probably akin to a piddle in the ocean at this point :- )</p>

I sometimes don't agree with their OPINIONS (use a brain haters) but i still enjoy them. Also, if you hate film and want to review it, read the whole review rather reading the rating.

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[8]]<br/>This is my rating for the film. But all these negative reviews are just pathetic and laughable. 'The characters are cliched' this is what small town Australians were like in the early 70s. Watch Wake in Fright, that proved my point after watching RD for the first time. 'a typical love story' that may be typical but that's not the plot of it, it's called Red Dog, it's meant to be a biography, not story. 'the jokes are cliched' some are but if you observe the acting and directing, it still makes it funny.</p>

Didn't they read about it or read reviews? Or did they go to rubbish it and/or walk out in high dudgeon?<br/>Also they were supposedly, ADULTS. <br/>Why not get kids to review films that are made expressly for FAMILIES and KIDS? instead of NARROW-MINDED, humourless, arty-farty, bores.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[0]]<br/>Hated it, loathed it, despised it.   Totally overrated.  This is a feel bad movie for so many reasons.  Bad acting, sentimental slop, poorly written, witless,  unoriginal (Greyfriar's Bobby), blokey-ugly, humourless and incredibly sad for the dog  (the real dog, that is).  This film is about the eventual and long term suffering of an actual dog.  It is depressing.  The trite device of the arrival of a new puppy at the end  failed to manipulate me into thinking this wretched film had anything feel-good about it.  Horrid.

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[6]]<br/>Very ordinary film. Dull and breaking no new ground.  Sentimental. Hackneyed. I didn't engage with any of the characters they all seemed like props even the dogs. Though they  had a winning turn of the head.  I didn't want to know any more about any of the characters.  I'm being a bit generous with the rating as it is an Aussie film</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[4]]<br/>I lived inDampier and Knew Red Dog and John.<br/>I feel that they could have made a more accurate movie of Red Dog and still made it interesting and funny.<br/>Why did they have to use an American to play the part of John when there are plenty of Australian actors who could have played the part more convincingly.<br/>Even though we were sad at the way Red Dog died (poisened) It has been portrayed in the movie that Red Dog brought the town together. The town was never divided to start with.<br/><br/> The movie was a bit of a kids movie.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[10]]<br/>Surely the verdict must have been reached on this film by now.  What stunning achievements - box office success, AFI members choice, Best Film and the highest sales for an Australian DVD that have ever been achieved.  The primary point of the film is the loyal and unique relationship between human and animal - which the film captures the essence of. It's not simply a story about one dog, but a story about everyone's loved pet.  Anyone who has been lucky enough to experience such a bond will be intensely moved by the film, which is its beautiful universal theme.</p>

Who cares if the film was not 100 percent accurate, the only human and canine who can verify the facts are no longer with us (and  may they R.I.P)   With all the violence on our idiot boxes today, it is a pleasure to see a film that makes you laugh, makes you cry and makes "you bloody proud to be Australian."  Yes, us Aussies are a weird mob but that is what makes us so unique!</p>

I'm too cynical for anthropomorphic make-believe - after having to suspend belief from the first scene of putting down the star prior to a response from the vet??? More artifice than art, this smells more like Wet Dog.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[4]]<br/>The scenery, the music and the dog were all delightul, but overall, I was dissapointed. <br/><br/>The lack of believable dialogue really killed it for me. Australians have a very specific way of speaking - a few "streuths" thrown in does not cut it. <br/><br/>That, and the American lead. I was actually quite insulted that the "true-owner", the romantic lead, and only really good looking character was American. <br/><br/>By the end of it, I felt like the film was deliberately trying to manipulate my emotions, making the sad scenes as sad as possible. I didn't cry; instead I cringed.</p>

From the moment that appalling pseudo Italian bleated on in his faux accent to the fist shaking mob sorting out the 'baddies' the film left no ham-acting stone unturned. Awful. But not bad enough to be good. Astonished at M &amp; Ds reviews. Kept expecting John Michael Howson to appear to the side of the screen and whisper 'it's behind you'. Half a star for the dog.</p>

Acting 8/10 - very good<br/>2. Story Line 6/10 - too predictable <br/>3. Script 2/10 - no excuses - false dialogue<br/>4. Intellecetual Stimulation 3/10 - better than script. Having this is a cardinal sin in any film.<br/>5. Humour 7/10 - only because of the good acting<br/>5.

Its suppose to be for the family and kids are suppose to identify the characters easily, mission accomplished.<br/>Regarding the film. Go watch it, don't expect it to be an acting powerhouse nor a deep character study.its a film about the legend of Red Dog. it'll make you laugh and it'll make you cry.

Then to find out that our kelpie Gus is cousin to Koko and that our other kelpie Fluer has a story has connections to the real Red Dog brings the whole tale well and truly to home.  Red Dog connects you to the old Australia, the Australia many of  us knew as kids, the Australia many of us grew up with, the old time Country Australia.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[8]]<br/>We found it a perfect movie to see under the starts at the St George Open Air Cinema on Australia Day.  Perhaps it is not great cinema or real social commentary but it captured a lovely and positive spirit of community and some of the true beauty  of our country.   I would certainly recommend the film.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[3]]<br/>Jingoistic, contrived, complete with the yank blow in, how could it not be a success?<br/>Cringe-worthy and obvious, it tries to cover all bases. <br/>Where are the aboriginal characters? It seems that most celebrations of the inclusiveness of Australian culture seem to dwell on the Greek/Italian/other angle and forget indigenous Australians. Look at fat pizza. <br/>Also, on a technical point, the Land Rover looks to be a circa 1980 6 cylinder ex-army. <br/>As  SIII was released in 1971 they would much more likely be driving a series II or IIA in 1971, not an ex-army SIII.</p>

It was dross,  questionable humour and barely entertainment - yawn - yes the dog was a charmer and clever but the script was '70s genre and crap. <br/>PS where were the indigenous people, quite invisible it would seem</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[1]]<br/>Hugely disappointing. I live abroad and love Aussie films but this was charmless and unfunny. How dare folk write comments like "anyone who doesn't like this movie is not a true Australian"?! We are not a nation of sheep. Why an American lead actor? And the mocking of the Italian miner reminded me of 'They're a Wierd Mob', from 50 years ago.  People who give it a '5', what would you score a quality  film? 'Family films' don't usually have references to 'drinking and whoring', so what is the film's market? <br/>PS: David and Margaret, tsk tsk.<br/><br/><br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[1]]<br/>Awful, awful film.<br/>I genuinely felt totally ripped off by this one. I found myself cringing from the start at the ridiculously stereotypical characters. <br/>A lazy film that perpetuates a dreadful depiction of Australians. Apparently we are all racist boozing, fighting swearing arse-hats. <br/>Likeable characters are either American or girls from Home and Away.<br/>A deplorable entry into Australian film that will no doubt be loved by some who don' t mind a bit of spoon-fed, tear-jerking drama about a dog.<br/>Of course everyone was sadder to see the dog die than the human but that isn't unusual.<br/>I'll never watch it again.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br/>This was not a masterpiece but was an exremely well crafted film.<br/><br/>It is easy to pick fault, as some bits were bordering on the 'corney', but it was in the nature of the telling of a 'yarn'.<br/><br/>I wonder whether the film producer really thinks Dampier was British, or whether this was a deliberate device to characterise the level of awareness of outback workers? <br/><br/>4.5 stars for a fresh, valuable entertaining film that was not intended to be classic high cinema.  There are parts that could have been done better - eg the shark fin.<br/><br/>100 word limit cuts me off<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[10]]<br/>I loved this movie!<br/>People who hate this movie, try to put yourself in the dogs shoes. Waiting for someone you loved, someone who would never return, and then go looking for that person and not having a chance of finding him. The music really helps with the 1970's setting. I love the music. You'll never find a dog as loyal as red dog. I think the script was really good and I loved the actors. So people hating this movie, stop trolling, and just say you didn't like it as much as most people<br/>(Watched Red Dog 6 times)</p>

Have visited them several times and traveled with them through Australia for the last 12 years. Thanks to them I fell in love with Australia and the Australians.<br/>I absolutely loved this movie. I cried, I smiled, I laughed and I cried some more.. Great music ! The Aussie landscape was captured beautifully and it truly represents the true Aussie values of community and friendship.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[2]]<br/>A juvenile effort despite all the pretty pictures. A lame script, silly characterizations, and stereotyping betray no real effort to portray Australia as it is.  Surely they could have found an Italo-Australian to play the bloke from Abruzzi - his fake accent is atrocious.  Badly paced, the only really good scene was the few seconds that related the Italian guy's daydream of life with his new-found love - sharp, funny, and measured - all things the rest of the movie lacks.</p>

I felt especially uncomfortable with the standing-on-the-table oration scenes. They seemed designed to elicit a typically jingoistic audience response.  I would not have been surprised if they shouted  "Aussie, Aussie, Aussie, oi, oi, oi".<br/>Overrated, but I think the kids like it.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[1]]<br/>Wow, this was terrible! Why is it that Australian film must have this weird campness about it? I was sceptical as to how they might be able to make movie about a stray kelpie in a mining town and now feel vindicated. Short answer is that they can't and they certainly shouldn't have. Margaret &amp; David, what were you thinking? Half a star for the dog's performance, nobody else deserves any of the hype associated with this stinker. As a film making nation, we need to do better than this.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[10]]<br/>To all those complaining about this film...you clearly have absolutely no idea what it means to be Australian. Red Dog is the best Australian movie I have ever seen. For me, it made me laugh, cry and smile all at the same time, and it truly represents the true Aussie values of community and friendship. Anyone who hates Red Dog would have to have a very miserable life. 5 stars.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[8]]<br/>I finally sat down to watch Red Dog.  I didn't want to because I knew the ending, the motorbike was from 1977 the P76 and  Kingswood from 73 and 72. BUT as I work in this part of the world and have done for many years I am sorry to tell those tossers who "cringed" at the accents and felt the characters where "cliched" they in fact are a fair representation of the cross section of that part of the world.  If you didn't get Red Dog for what it was you missed the essence of a good Aussie Yarn.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[5]]<br/>I found the characters very likeable.   What i do get annoyed with though are these "true story" movies which have not much "true content" in them at all.  The rest is made up.  <br/><br/>A quick google search will show that John's surname was Stazzonelli and not Grant.  Red Dog is buried  in an unmarked grave somewhere between Dampier and Karratha and not anywhere near the grave sight of John Stazzonelli as the film would suggest.<br/><br/>A nice movie but being based on a true story is stretching the truth as the relationship between Red Dog and John is very much exaggerated.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[0]]<br/>Red Dog is probably the most execrable piece of crap I have seen in a long, long time. It is laughable, an embarrassment that wallows in its own jellimeat. Of most embarrassment, however, has been the childishly uncritical Australian response. Was it P T Barnum who said: "Nobody ever went broke underestimating public taste"? Walt Disney at his schmalziest would never have stooped to this drivel, indeed his productions Old Yeller (1957) and Greyfriars Bobby (1961) traversed this territory with much more finesse and grace.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br/>The story was patchy and padded out a bit, the acting and stars pretty good, great dog.  I went through Dampier in 1981, don't remember seeing the statue, but thought it was an interesting (small) place. That country is red, but the film jacked it up a bit.  Anyway, thoroughly enjoyed it, made me teary at the end but I loved the touch of the new puppy.  How true is the story?  All in all a great family film.</p>

How many kilowatts to light up the scene where the truck drives up in the beginning, and, how do you pull a beer in no time with a searchlight in your face. From then on it was cringe, cringe, cringe. Worse than 'Australia', an insult to the intelligence of Australians to score it highly.<br/><br/>It's about time D &amp; M subtracted three from their ratings of Oz films. Time to retire.</p>

Sure they characters were stereotypes but I think it captured Australia pretty well!<br/><br/>A great movies for anyone, especially dog owners.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[10]]<br/>My favourite Aussie film ! I laughed and cried, and I cant wait to go to Dampier next year and have my photo taken with Red Dog . The movie ticks all the boxes. I highly recommend everyone to see such a classic Australian story.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[1]]<br/>There's something very infantile about the characters and direction of this film. I think it struggles to decide on whether the pitch was towards kids or adults. Sloppy, disjointed and inauthentic. But I guess such criticism of a home-grown movie makes me UNAUSTRALIAN. Margaret and David - Conflict of interest much?</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[10]]<br/>Red Dog was one of the best movies I've ever seen. It had an incredible story line that really hit me. It was one of those movies that really mean something to you and it just hits you. It was truly amazing. The end of the movie was the saddest, but I find the best part, because Red Dog's finally back with John. &lt;3</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[8]]<br/>We do have a little gem in Red Dog, a fine family film indeed. After a slightly awkward opening, a natural rhythm begins to flow through the screenplay as Red Dog chooses his master. The bonding between man and dog, and the romance looming are each beautifully staged and convincing. Cinematography is excellent  as is the soundtrack which is guaranteed to have many loving this journey. You can see which direction Red Dog is headed and it will leave you knowing something special awaits. The finale is touching and will leave Red Dog an Aussie film to remember.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[1]]<br/>Weak acting/script, predictable and melodramatic story, corny dialog, repetitive montages (maybe venture into music videos Kriv). <br/><br/>This is the most embarrassing Australian film I have ever seen. I am afraid I have lost faith in humanity if the general public and you D&amp;M, are entertainment and moved by this utter piece of rubbish...</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[10]]<br/>Not only an absolutely amazing and heart touching story, The Australian actors were so much more true to life than the Hollywood actors of today! Without question, one of the finest films I have ever viewed. There was No other choice but to rate this  film a 5 star!<br/> God Bless everyone involved in bringing 'Red Dog's' legacy to life across the globe! It shows the unconditional love a dog has for mankind, which so many people could learn from 'Red Dog' !</p>

I am searching for one very similar to Red Dog. I loved the movie. I cried &amp; laughed, it bought out my emotions &amp; what I want in a dog. Buying DVD when it is out. I just loved Red Dog.

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[2]]<br/>Just saw it because it's set in Aus, is about a dog and was rated well by M&amp;D. Your reviews are funnier than the film - 'even the dog looked like it was acting" - ha! Terrible love story, she was like a militant fem and girls did not speak like that in the 70s, dreadfully cliched characters, poorly acted, far too long... I'm not a snob - enjoyed The Castle, Pricilla, Crackerjack. I'm up for a laugh and cry at a movie, but this didn't do it for me.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[3]]<br/>Really wanted to like this film but the overly hammed-up stereotypes were too blunt and unfunny for me. Took away any emotional pull the film might otherwise have had. In particular, the smarmy American and the guy from the "village" of Abruzzi (my ancestry is partly Abruzzese and I can confirm it is a region much like a state, not a village), grated on my nerves. The pro-mining tones didn't help. And the Luhrman-styled dialogue didn't allude at all to the state of WA I know - It may as well have been set in Texas. Not for adults.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br/>I saw this film in an outdoor cinema in broome, not too far from where the movie is set, and a perfect location for watching the movie! The movie itself is a winner. Yes the characters are cliches (or more accurately, charicatures of typical Aussies), and the script doesn't provoke thought, but it's a delightful movie with genuine emotional impact. it's definitely worth seeing.</p>

I think you would have to be a dog lover to get it - perhaps the people who have rated it poorly seek for "higher" things - and obviously are not dog lovers;  a great movie with a great dog!</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[10]]<br/>I'm a seventeen year old girl and (I have to say) not normally a lover of dogs and 'Australian' films per se. Like David, I had initial misgivings - particularly because of the 70s fashion - but by the end I was bawling and chuckling (most unusual for me!). The cinematography was  beautiful, but it was the story that really won it for me. Red Dog, for me, symbolises an unswerving loyalty - and the way he connects the characters was truly special. LOVED it, and would recommend to everyone.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[7]]<br/>Yeah, not too bad: good scenery, great dog - but what about the cat? No one seems to mention the feline. That's sad. <br/><br/>Acting? There wasn't much except Arthur Angel, who hammed it up over Azzuri, and the Van Park Leasee. All the rest were a bit ho-hum.<br/><br/>It's a storyline with no surprises, all very predictable, set in the real winner, Dampier. Doesn't make me hanker to visit, though.<br/><br/>For all that, I blubbered and laughed my way through a pleasant Saturday arvo, so it must have some merit. My emotional thermometer was running hot.</p>

Can't believe people like this film..<br/>Come on SA Film Corp you helped produce Storm Boy and Shine - what happened in Red Dog - only the dog was believable!</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[10]]<br/>I really loved this movie. I didn't know until I'd read this that is was funded by a mining company. I certainly didn't focus on the mining going on in the movie - Koko the dog was amazing. And sure it was a wee bit twee and superficial, but as a movie "experience" I am glad I saw it at the cinema. I felt good while watching it and afterwards and that's what matters to me.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[8]]<br/>   This film is a superb adaptation from pom Louis de Bernaires' book of the same name. Both are set in the ubiquitous red dust of the Pilbara in WA. Red Dog the kelpie, star of the movie, is as engrossing a character as the dinkum Aussie blokes and sheilas who all work in and around the iron ore mines and they all love him. Now I'm no fan of either dogs nor the arid outback, but this movie had me sucked right in.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[8]]<br/>Oh for the love of gawd...why can't people just take this film for what it is? This isn't Shakespeare, and it's not meant to be a political statement about the mining industry or the Aboriginal culture. It's about the DOG and said dog's loyalty, and the sense of community. Sure, it's full of cliches and the acting is a bit naff, but it's a non-pretentious, delightful, heart-warming story about a wonderful dog &amp; how he touched the community. It's not ultra violent, no drug use and little special effects. Brilliant work by all involved in this little gem.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[10]]<br/>We laughed, cheered, clapped and we cried. It is hard to imagine that it is more than thirty years since Red Dog died and he was around for ten years at least.<br/><br/>The movie captures the spirit of the working communities in the North of WA very well indeed. And how come no one ever mentions the Red Cat?<br/><br/>We know nothing of the story of the dog sitting on the Tuckerbox, ten miles from Gundagai. We all know the story of Red Dog.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br/>Both my wife and I loved it. I also shed quite a few tears near the end both for the girl losing her financee and especially the dog's unlamenting search and death. The swearing was a bit much but that is part of the miners' persona. I loved the old cars for the period , especially the 1961 Holden and the 1970's fashions. The realtionship with Red dog and the cat was great and charming. In conclusion, a darn fine movie !</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[8]]<br/>Red dog is a truly heart felt and uplifting Australian film, filled with humour and emotion.  I definitely recommend it to anyone out there looking for their moneys worth.  I loved the mining men throughout the movie, the words and actions they came out with were classic. What a thoughtful and clever choice when choosing the dog, played the role exeptionally!!</p>

It tells an honest, heart felt story and you will need to take tissues. I cried like a baby. We should celebrate this gem of a film and the success its achieved here and inevitably overseas. How long has it been since an Aussie fil was #1 at the box office. Go Red Dog....go you good thing!!!!!!</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[2]]<br/>I don't understand the appeal of this film at all. It has a plodding and incoherent plot which is melodramatic at the best of times and patronising at the worst. It reinforces cringeworthy stereotypes and uses tired vernacular and pitiful jokes in lieu of an actual script. Sure there are occasional moments where you can engage emotionally but the rest feels forced and manufactured. Arguments against may include my favourite comment: "it's just a bit of fun," but there are more coherent , better written "bits of fun" to watch rather than waste my time with this.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[8]]<br/>Red dog was completely off my radar when I went to see it. I had heard it was good but never really was interested in it. I eventually went to see it with my friends and I was pleasantly surprised. I could hear laughter all throughout the audience and by the end, no eye was left dry. Its one of those movies you find hard to hate. I think some people might be thrown off when seeing the trailers, but you have too see this. It is one of the best Australian films I have seen in a long time.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[8]]<br/>This is a lovely film. I didn't bawl my eyes out, but a few men did, which I found interesting.<br/>The era was very well done and transported me back. This film reminded me of the things that make a people great,  a big heart, justice, compassion, kindness and mercy. <br/>Growing up in the country (on a real working farm) and on observation, I can tell you that a dog truely is mans best friend.<br/>Everything about this Film was lovely.<br/>Best Aussie film in a long time.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[10]]<br/>I've been working up and around dampier for a long time now, I read the book a few years ago and instantly became interested in red dog and his adventure, the mermaid pub is a bit different nowadays but I loved this movie because it tells the story of a bloody good dog who everybody loved up there and is still the talking point in the pub on a Sunday arvo. I'll still tell his story to the fellas who haven't heard it. watch it just to learn of this wonderful dog who did bring a lot of people together!</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[3]]<br/>Being a West Australian, I am always up for films from the West.  But again and again I am disappointed.  Red Dog is no exception. The premise of this film is excellent, a family would be open to seeing a film like this in the school holidays.  Unfortunately it seems as if it has been made specifically for the American market.  Stereotypical, one dimensional characters like the miner, are quite predictable.  I think Western Australia can do much better than this,  if Red Dog, Last train to Freo and the TV show Street Smartz is anything to go by....</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[1]]<br/>D&amp;M must be fair dinkum joking or have shares in Woodside/Rio Tinto. Made as compensation for the community they've profited from and a recruiting travelogue, it has a script below amateurish, awkward set ups, embarrassing characterisations, is fake, corny, cliched, clunky, wooden, badly sentimental, built like a series of 21st speeches in a pub. I'm stunned by the positive reviews below, that so many Australian cinemagoers consume and love such awful trash; but more shocked by Margaret and David - this is taking support of Oz film beyond the limit and shakes the ground of my confidence in your honesty.</p>

Yes, it will make you laugh, ponder and definitely cry a bit (or maybe a little more if you have a sensitive bone in your body).  The landscapes are stunning and the brightness of light in the film tells you that this really is northern Australia, similar to "The Proposition".<br/>D &amp; M nailed it perfectly with their reviews, don't worry about the pretentious naysayers.

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br/>Mmmm, I wonder what the definition of great art is? Boring, complicated, tedious and unenjoyable? Somehow I don't think so. I think the film excels in terms of concept, subject, entertainment factor, emotionality and so on.  There is the blending of truth, with the many references to traditional legends and stories of its kind.  Watch Greyfriars Bobby from 1961 and see the many references - the caravan park attendants, the dog and his master's grave, and so on. Brilliant I think, and gorgeous to see in an Australian context.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[8]]<br/>Surprisingly enjoyable yarn. In the true spirit of outback Aussie yarns, it is a bit cheesy, a bit funny, a bit tragic and a bit true.<br/>Keeping it as a story of a very appealing, cheeky, loyal red kelpie and not a broader picture of 70's life in the Pilbara (complete with mistreatment of Aboriginal people) I think is necessarily simplistic.<br/>For the naysayers, take a drive up the centre, head west to the Kimberley, then start driving down. Better still, get a job up there for a while. It will change your perspective.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[8]]<br/>An entertaining movie, beautifully filmed. Anyone who has worked with animals will appreciate the huge effort the filmmakers went to, to produce a quality production. It's interesting 80% of comments are  positive and the rest  negative. Yes, there are cliches and the script is not deep. Yet this film works as a story because Red is a plausible character. My husband has travelled extensively in this area and says the  characterization of the people  is spot-on. <br/>The naysayers take themselves far too seriously - this movie was worth watching and should be accepted for what it is - good entertainment.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[10]]<br/>Yes, if you want to be a pretentious prat, you could pick many faults with this film.  It is not great art, but then it never has pretended to be.  It is offered up as pure entertainment to make you laugh and cry.  At this it succeeds like few films before it.  Certainly no Australian film can touch this for fun (and tears).  Very highly recommended.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[8]]<br/>Clear blue skies and an arid rust red wilderness closes in the raucous community of Dampier back in the early seventies.The movie starts hesitantly, based on a series of short Red Dog adventures. But the danger of a group of characters telling their own particular red dog yarn in turn evaporates with the arrival of Red Dog's only master, and the movie's central love story, John and Nancy. From that moment on the story flies on a heady mix of love, loss and exhuberance to its inevitable end. Beautiful, sad, funny but always optimistic. I loved it!</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[5]]<br/>Plodding, episodic script by numbers, the obligatory US import had nothing much to do, the romance was awkward and the relationship unexplored. The endless celebration of our alcoholic culture was troubling. The general storyline was cute, but typically slight and quirky as our Australian movies are prone to be. Something to do with our script development and funding preferences. I find we always have a problem when middle-class, urban-dwelling actors try to portray the working class - it never quite rings true. Overall I'm pleased it's found an audience, but it left me with a headache, or maybe a hangover.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[2]]<br/>I went to see this movie with high expectations but could not have been more let down. I have traveled this country far and wide over 30 years and think the portrayal of Dampier and it's people is poor. The film makes a mockery of the town,it's people, the dog and I think Australians in general.  It's not at all endearing. Some are saying it's up there with The Castle. I say "tell em they're dreamin' "</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[8]]<br/>I read de Berniere's book a few years ago and really loved it, which made me nervous about seeing the film version. Yes it is a bit sachrine, but so what? I didn't go expecting to have my socks blown off but I was really very pleasantly surprised.  I found the film quite engaging. I laughed, I cried and I was entertained and probably like many others- I went home and hugged my dog. <br/>PS The daggy 70's songs were great and I loved the scene with the two drunks dancing on the night of the engagement party.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br/>I think that is the other universal theme of the film - relationships, grief and loss. I can't really understand why that is seen as saccharine, cliched etc. I'm not an overly sentimental person, but the film really hit me in that respect. Thankfully though, there are plenty of joyous moments as well!</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br/>The half I didn't add to make it five is due to the slow start, but this was a brilliant movie, brilliant interpretation of the novel and a beautiful rendering of a true story.  [Though I do know the real, real story is a lot sadder...and not because of what happened to Red Dog]<br/><br/>To those who didn't like this movie and didn't rate it highly, don't forget that this was based on a true story so to malign it is to malign the truth behind it.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[2]]<br/>This is pretty mediocre, even for a family movie. So cliched and saccharin. I just wanted it to end. My kids liked though so maybe that's the demographic. The production values are quite good. Couldn't help being shocked by how Noah Taylor has aged. Hope it was makeup!</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[10]]<br/>A film that made me feel very proud to be an Aussie. ( a feeling I don't get all that often these days!)<br/> It had many virtues:  its portrayal of the Australia of the great open spaces; its wonderful use of the time honoured Aussie tradition of yarning; the positive, universal  human values presented in an authentically Australian story; its valuing of the long,long,relationship between humans and dogs. <br/>And it was fun, yet often also intensely moving. I think it will be an Australian classic.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[3]]<br/>I live in a WA mining town and watched this film in Mt Isa (about 4 people in the cinema). I don't go to many films because outback town cinemas tend to cater to the kiddies' movie tastes but I'd heard this was good. I got seriously bored and felt self-conscious as a grown adult watching this.Mining people where I come from are not like that. Maybe they were in the 70's but I doubt it. I'm sure kids will love it - reminds me how I loved the South African movie Jock of Bushveld when I was about 6.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br/>Why would Margaret and David's ratings be so hard to understand (for a minority of people)? M and D seem to have nailed it. The film has had much critical acclaim, has experienced unprecedented word of mouth success and has even made an impression internationally at its previews.  Also, I don't think I've ever seen so many audience reviews for a film on this site. Maybe the cultural cringe factor put a few people off.  However, I think the film is very unique for its universal depiction of the relationship between humans and animals. This really makes it special.</p>

This country is so full of culture, history, tradition, good and bad and this is the only thing we can come up with.<br/><br/>I think Magaret &amp; David are going a bit senile to even rate this movie, it was just embarrassing. <br/>Its not even sure what it is:<br/>Is it an inappropriate kids movie or a lame adult movie.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[10]]<br/>I'm a 6 foot 4, 135kg man and the only thing bigger in the cinema was the lump in my throat. I seen Red Dog tonight and I though I'll be able to stretch out in the cinema as this movies been out a while and it's Aussie so there will be no one there. I was wrong!! It was packed, then came the laughter then the tears. Now I may have managed to hold them back (just) but no one else could including the men. Great story, beautiful landscape, top characters and a dog!</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[1]]<br/>I'm an animal lover and have owned dogs my whole life but that's no excuse for seeing and promoting such a woeful movie.  I'm all for supporting the Australian film industry but to give this movie 4/4.5 stars and compare to the Castle and Priscilla as some others have is an insult to those great movies.  <br/>The acting is terrible and the jokes not that funny.  I'm by no means a film afficianado but this movie is too simple to be anything other than a kids movie.<br/>D &amp; M have lost a lot of credibility pushing this crap.</p>

I found myself pushing backwards in the chair involuntarily to get away from it.<br/><br/>I found it embarrassing and am surprised they have put their names to it.<br/><br/>Really unsure about David and Margaret's ratings.

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[10]]<br/>Iaskyou, we also saw the film on 5 September at Sun Pictures in Broome.  Not a spare seat and everyone laughed and cried!! The fact this film is getting this type of reaction from Aussies all round the country, and this long after the release date, is the only review that matters - we all love it!!! And we are originally from Poland and my dad works in mining, we know the cliches and they are true, ahahahaha!! We love Red Dog!! Xx<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[10]]<br/>Absolutely bloody fantastic, a great movie loved the actors and Koko, if your true blue how could you not love it. I dont get the wowsers here that did not like it, all I can say is get out in the country a bit more often and mix with the real characters portrayed here. I dont want to frighten you darlings but there are some great people still out in the bush, come out from from under the rock and enjoy this great country and the dinkum people in it, buy an Aussie dictionary if you need to understand dinkum.</p>

Sorry to disappoint all of you who cringed at the accents or the acting or whatever, but the place and the people were really like that. The filmmakers were really accurate.

I also loved it's depiction of the 1970's and it was great to hear Stevie Wright's "Evie" once more, but The Angels' "Shadow Boxer" was a bit of an anachronism.</p>

I can understand the appeal of this movie, but so much of it was poorly handled and didn't make sense - such as the attempted shooting in the head of the dog at the beginning of the film.  Would a dog so loved really be subjected to that?<br/>So many production gimmicks were used pointlessly.<br/>I'm impressed by story of the journey of the dog.<br/>I love M and D, but their rating is ridiculous!</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[8]]<br/>I wasn't that excited about seeing this movie, but I just loved it. <br/>I laughed and cried and I could completely relate to the characters as I have worked a remote job before. <br/>For those saying that they acting was bad, you are taking the movie way too seriously. They are meant to be characters and taken as comical, which they were.<br/>I loved everything about this movie and the fact that it is based on a True story makes it even better in my book.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[4]]<br/>Not the finest piece of filmaking you'll see. Poor casting made worse by lazy/cheesy acting. Agree with the comments re poor representation of the 70s -unlike Paper Giants, which nailed it, this movies clumsy attempts simply failed. Also the way characters like "Ski Patrol" were introduced "Reservoir Dogs" style was over done, unoriginal and unnecessary.<br/><br/>Ok as an 80s style tele-movie, wait for the DVD. Doesn't pass the "lets's get a babysitter" test.<br/><br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br/>This movie did slow down a little bit in the middle however I can't understand why people are seeing messages that aren't there! Saying it's against the aboriginal community? I'd say those people have the issues with aboriginals as I didn't think about such issues when I was watching this great piece of film. Why do people have to over think things when clearly this film is a simple story about a dog and its joinery. Great film, worth seeing.</p>

I was captivated in my chair for the entire movie and really loved the intelligent, cheeky and lovable nature of Red Dog.<br/><br/>This is a movie for all to see and it will really appeal to all animal lovers.  I really liked the way in which Red Dog affected people's lives.<br/><br/>This movie makes one appreciate our four-legged friends.  I haven't enjoyed a movie like Red Dog for a very long time.<br/><br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[0]]<br/>I'd never considered walking out of a film until I saw Red Dog.  I resisted, buoyed by Margaret and David's reviews - thinking "surely this must get better".  It didn't.  This shallow, jingoistic, disgracefully badly scripted piece of predictable cliched rubbish caused my husband and I to cringe repeatedly in our seats.  It takes more than a shot of paper $2 notes to evoke the 70's.  The lead actress was an atrociously miscast thoroughly 21st century irritant, the "hard men" of the mine a bunch of thoughtful souls with ludicrously flawless dentistry. Americanisms littered the script.  Where's the "minus" star?</p>

Only good thing was the truthful depiction of the 70's- the clothes, cars and the music. Koko did a good job too - only actor that did.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[8]]<br/>An easy going Aussie movie that's hard to hate.  Great casting - Koko as Red Dog, the Pilbara, and soundly rooted into the 1970s.  The screenplay structure with flashes to stories that tell the story worked.  Characters vary from realistically believable to overacted charactatures.  Vanno the Abruzzi tragic mostly grated, but the overall realistic believability lent it authenticity.  Yes, it's easy to see why the federal, WA and SA governments, Rio Tinto and others supported this production, and possibly the outcomes reflect this.  But I'm glad the film was made, the story told, and told well.</p>

For heavens sake, it is based on a legend so much of it is tongue in cheek.  What a shame that person didn't watch it with an Australian sense of humour because it really was delightful fun. Lighten up, mates!<br/><br/>The makers of this film brought us the beauty of the North West of WA and the humour of its people.  We sat and allowed ourselves to be entertained. Loved it!</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br/>It was a great tearjerker and animal film. Australian of an old an proud type, it gives us and anyone overseas a view, a slant on Australia. The doggy was marvellous and the people supported him well. You can make (presumably) cheap movies with an interesting and scenic setting, a gallery of believable characters of real depth and interest, and the talents of this lovable canine heartstealer.

I mean, oh dear oh dear. Both were just chronically bad. Red Dog is embarrassing. I am from a wog background and seriously, the obviously false accents were so dreadful I just cringed through the whole lot of it. WHY are you suddenly SO way off. The acting was so bad it was hard to believe. Even the dog looked like it was acting.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[5]]<br/>I read all the reviews and so approached it with an open mind. Well after seeing the movie I wonder where the real David and Margaret are! - have aliens from planet B inhabited their bodies. Putting aside all biasness and politically motivated views, it was a movie that was rushed; there were some shocking scene changes, some very annoying characters. Best performers were Red Cat and the caravan park caretaker and his wife..the rest including the dog were so so.. There were some touching moments in between the scenes that left me cringing and the ones that were ludicrous.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[1]]<br/>Exaggerated ocker accents, racial stereotyping, terribly lame one liners and hackneyed sentamentality all converged to create one of the most cringeworthy Australian films of recent times. Not only that, for some reason the film makers decided to depict the story's central human charatcer as an American. Perhaps the novel on which the film is based also portrayed the hero character of John as a vagabond yank, however I found this characterisation completely unsavoury and one which caused the outback Australian blokes in the film to be relegated to uncultivated buffoons in comparison. The half star goes to koko the dog.</p>

The laconic humor is so Aussie, great music (especially if you are over 40 (I am over 60) and I was with Margaret bawling my eyes out at the near end.  For the family, no swearing, the cat and dog fight (??) was so funny with no sensibilities offended.  Beautifully filmed, and what scenery!!  Highly recommended for a great family flick.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[5]]<br/>Beautiful scenery, loved the dog, very moving towards the end which is when the movie found it's feet. Otherwise bad acting and cartoonish characters which distracted from the story. What was the purpose of the silly cat/dog fight scenes? I grew up with Italians and don't remember anyone with an accent like the 'Italian' in the film. What an insult. And why was everyone dancing and having a great time when Red dog was dying? Maybe the movie should be called Unreal Red Dog.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[10]]<br/>I loved the dry humour that represents the tough men and women from the north west. The loyalty of Red Dog and his extraordinary journey are incredible and it is great to finally see a true Aussie film again. Move over Australia, this is a movie about the true Australians. I admit it moved me to tears at least 4 times, happy and sad! A great movie.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[0]]<br/>I really didn't like this.  Disappointed because usually I can rely on M and D's reviews.  I can't understand why they liked it.  It's so predictable and sentimental and I kept looking at my watch whenever there was enough light on the screen. The humour is really obvious.  Why is this getting raves???  I don't get it....</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[7]]<br/>Took my elderly  parents (who were visiting), my partner and my 12 year old son.  The cinema was packed and everyone cried. I normally can't stand dog movies; and I will admit to really liking this one. I was amazed to learn that this was a true story. I loved the 70s fashions and the soundtrack "stumblin' in" was a stand out. I was a kid in that era and remember with fondness  the songs and fashions. The American was gorgeous. The themes of masculinity, isolation, community and love are all here. Take the whole family.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[0]]<br/>So far removed from the real Pilbara we should be ashamed - reminded me of a weird expoitation flick where laughing at dogs and wogs replaces the reality of an industry that neccessarliy relies upon the dispossession of indigenous peoples. Our culture is on the line in this film which means we've clearly sold out to those funding it - foreign owned mining companies. They say "it would be un-Australian not to share Red Dog's spirit with the world" - what a joke! This film wasn't even scripted by Aussies! Total whitewash public relations propaganda for mining &amp; tourism.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[4]]<br/>I couldn't come at Red Dog- it was just too unbelievable. Do miners really interact like that with each other where they all listen and emote and be sensitive? In the ensemble scenes the actors didn't know what to do with themselves because everything was just so divorced from reality. The plot was very predictable and the leads were wooden, boring. That said, the dog and the cat were entertaining and the outback beautiful.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br/>I have not liked too may Aussie films except for the Dish.   I really enjoyed this film as it really typified our iconic nature as Aussies to love somthing so simple as a dog and the impact he had on the lives of many hard working Aussies and immigrants back in the 70's.   It was hugely entertaining evoking many emotions from sadness through to humour.   It was not overacted as some have stated, the focus was Koko and boy he was great.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[5]]<br/>There are delightful moments in this very oz film, but it as a piece of film-making it is rather clumsy with some real corn occasionally. It lacks the finesse of The Castle (and what was that film about the guy who supplied portaloos?). David and Margaret have gone over the top about this one.</p>

The main reason i liked the movie is because I had a personal feel to the movie as I was born up north and go there for holidays every year. Red Dog reawakened my love for the north with it's awesome country side and environment. I can understand how others would not like the movie seeing as they might not be able to relate to that kind of Australia.</p>

Have no idea.<br/>I agree there was a bit of overacting. The Italian got on my nerves after a while.<br/>The 70s were my time but most of the music  they chose for the film left me cold. Why not one ABBA number? <br/>But I'm very happy that an Aussie film is being really successful once again.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br/>very good movie, took the children - son initially reluctant that it wasnt something 3d animated. Great to see an Australian movie that wasnt full of political messages and cultural cringe,and where every second word wasnt a swear word.The dog and the cat were great and in this day and age where dogs are SO over regulated it was fabulous to see a movie that celebrated the free spirit and loyalty  of a canine companion. Have read the book so was prepared for the dog's demise but even so found myself wishing I had brought more tissues.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[10]]<br/>I love dogs more than I love people - this films confirms the feeling.  It was light hearted and uplifting, lots of  laughs and tears, great scenery, terrific soundtrack and touches of sadness - what a mix.  Why would wowsers go and see a film like this and then condemn it .... stay home and shrivel up.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[8]]<br/>It is what it is. It wont win an Academy award but it is an enjoyable flick that is typical Australian. All the negative is probably written by silly little lefty arts students that can't see past Pulp Fiction. When you lot have kids you'll say oh I get it.  Grow up and don't be movie snobs! We're not all into ausy slash movies. Go with an open mind and enjoy the simple stuff.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[10]]<br/>I loved this film! It makes you laugh and cry and you leave with a sense of satisfaction. People are concerned about the Indigenous community, or the fact that it doesn't pay attention to what mining is doing to the land, but there is no room for political comment in this film...its about a beautiful dog and his love for a community. If you go in expecting something that its not then don't bother going. I loved it.</p>

Noah Taylor etc.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br/>My favorite Aussie film is The Castle followed a close 2nd Muriels Wedding. Along with Red Dog the acting is overdone &amp; cheesy but that is what I love about these movies. An Aussie yarn, told tongue in cheek style. This is a film I could take my Nana &amp; 9 year old to see which is rare now days. Decent PG films for all ages havnt been made for years. No smoking, swearing, tits n arse, explosions, 20 min car chases or shoot outs. Loved everything about this film including brilliant soundtrack.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br/>I don't think it's too hard to figure out why the film makers allowed the dog to attach to an American.  It had nothing to do with Australian-American politics, and everything to do with potential box office takings from a US audience (think Crocodile Dundee). Still, I don't care. I'm prepared to overlook any shortcomings. The film is wonderful, and in the fine tradition of Charlotte's Web and Born Free, it is a genuinely emotional and moving experience! Also, the cat fight scenes were highly realistic!!</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br/>Loved it! There have been so many Aussie films that my wife and I (Australians by choice, not by accident opf birth!) have enjoyed, but this was among the best. Would love to see  sequels to "Tomorrow When the War began" - another great, but underrated, Aussie movie.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[10]]<br/>Took up David and margaret's challenge to not ignore this Aussie film and must say I loved it. It was a distinctly quirky Australian film (much in the vein of the The Castle and Priscilla). This movie had none of the cultural cringe that made the movie "Australia" so impossible to watch with it's blown out budget. This movie is innocent, sweet, cinematically gorgeous to watch. The acting isn't perfect (particularly from Rachel Taylor but the movie is an ensemble so who cares...), but all the elements work together to make this a ripper of a film.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br/>A winner of a story which captures the spirit of mining communities at the Top End and the loyalty of dogs, in particular a beautiful red Kelpie/cattle dog name Koko. Oh and a lovely romance as well. It's a feel good film well told in the stunning, if barren environment of the Pilbara region. Best Aussie movie  for yonks.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[10]]<br/>Haven't enjoyed a movie, whether it be Australian or otherwise, so much in years. Got the balance between humor and pathos, romance and boys being boys, just right.<br/><br/>And it unexpectedly moved me a great deal, maybe because Red Dog is the spitting image of my adored chocolate Labrador.<br/><br/>It is a charming film, and deserves to be a huge international hit in the manner of Crocodile Dundee.</p>

The movie really resonated with those of us who live in the North and there wasn't a dry eye in the place at the end of the night- love the soundtrack and the dog was brilliant :-) it didn't harm anyone, just a bit of light hearted fun for once...</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[4]]<br/>I enjoyed this film with a nine and eleven year old, all of us finished in tears. However, on reflection I felt manipulated. I agree with Marg below ("an advertisement for the resources industry as good solid nation builders and loveable rogues"). I'm disappointed that 8.5m was spent on glorifying mining when actually the indigenous population, absent in the film, are having their land raped by mining for short term gains. Mining may have helped us dodge the GFC, but in the longer term, what a desecration of our beautiful land and disregard for indigenous connection to it.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[4]]<br/>Having inhabited pubs in mining towns in the 70's, I can't believe that noone, not even the Russians (?) were smoking. <br/>The absence of indigenous folk is not surprising - in the company towns I worked in they were not permitted to even visit, for example Leigh Creek in SA.<br/>As far as the movie goes, Koko stole the show, rest was not particularly representative of what good Australian film making (eg Lantana, Snowtown etc) is able to accomplish.

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[10]]<br/>I loved this movie, I love dogs and treasure the unique relationship we have with them so this was a winner for me. The fact that this is based on the experiences people had with a a real dog negates those criticisms of the dog choosing an American. It is what he did. I love the fact that in true Australian style the stories have gotten bigger and more colourful how true to form. I thought the feel of the film was great and the characters are architypal but just as in the Castle it really works.</p>

What it is though is a movie that is fun, enjoyable, worth going to watch.  A film that gives hope that there are original, australian stories to be told and be told in a humorous laconic way.

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br/>Having worked in the Pilbara in 1970 as a geologist, I can vouch for the authenticity of the 'human' characters portrayed in this classic Aussie tale. In the genre of The Castle, Muriel's Wedding and the Queen of Australia, this 'not to be taken too seriously' movie captures the quintessential charactor of Australian culture. A thoughly entertaining and heart-string pulling yarn skilfully directed with great performances from Red Dog and his adversary, the cat from hell!<br/><br/>The movie would have earned 5 stars in my books if the rather silly shark scene had been left on the cutting room floor!</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[1]]<br/>Why, oh WHY, would you cast a VERY sleazy yank as the one true owner that the dog attached to. The story line regarding the dog was a good story but it just didn't work - AT ALL. <br/><br/>Last week I saw your five star rating the Tree of Life, which as one astute viewer commented, should have been called the the Tree of Death.<br/><br/>I didn't think Australian's were embarrassed by Australian movies any more but Red Dog will change that.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[1]]<br/>I thought that moe where Robin Williams played a clown at a hospital was the most contrived movie I would ever see but no, it's red dog. <br/><br/>Firstly the Australian scences and the trains were great and music was fabulous...but the script....and the acting were truly dreadful. The fake and grating accents were awful and THAT, from the word go, from the first scene, is the saddest looking dog I have every seen. The only time it looked alive and happy was when the boring bad acting female was telling it she was not an 'executive assistant'. Strewth.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[1]]<br/>This film is awful. It is a propaganda movie for the resources industry.  No shots of the enormous open cut mines that dot the Pilbara landscape (most of the shots being confined to trains, processing plant and salt mines), and where were the Aboriginal communities?  This dog traveled all over the Pilbara and not an indigenous person in sight?  It disgusts me that companies are now colonising our artistic and film space.  This is an advertisement for the resources industry as good solid nation builders and lovable rogues, not a film.</p>

All the characters were wonderful and funny.It's nice to see an Australian film that isn't about criminals,sick'os,abuse, dysfunction and generally depressing subjects.When I went the theatre was full and mostly middle aged country people.I suspect many older men who never go to the movies went. I just hope everyone goes to see it and it gets worldwide distribution.It deserves many awards!</p>

I think it got better in the second half but it didn't really move me.  Maybe I'm in the minority as there was much sniffing and even sobbing to be heard from the audience in the session I attended.<br/>Not bad - but could have been very good with a better script.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[4]]<br/> Red Dog is a pleasant "nice" movie, but if you  look beneath the veneer too much then it seems a different kettle of fish. Its a great advertisement for the mining industry, the steroetype characters, the rough as guts Aussie who secretly knits,the Europeans who love to fight,the laconic yet accepted Yank,yep lets tick those boxes! The dog picking the American as his master,sounds too much like Australian/American political relationships already! Maybe my cynical nature has got the better of me but I came away from it with an uncomfortable feeling.<br/></p>

Made us laugh, cry and touched my partner who spent the eighties as a diesel mechanic in the WA outback. The dog deserves an oscar. If you enjoyed Murials Wedding, Simply Ballroom, Priscilla and The Castle, see this. And the shark scene is GREAT.</p>

Genuinely affecting and captures the period brilliantly (2 comically bad CGI shots notwithstanding, but they were played for laughs so I'll let them off).<br/>My 7yo girl loved it too, great turnout to my session, hope it does well.....<br/>....+ not a talking animal in sight, bliss :-)</p>

I worked for Dampier Salt as a courier, we had nine families living on site, so part of my job was to take the children to school in Dampier.Red Dog would jump in the back  of the  station wagon and jump out when we reached Dampier.I still to this day remember him being shot .This movie was done so well I hope all Australian get behind this true Aussie movie.

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[5]]<br/>I really couldn't care less about this film. I just felt it had the same lame Australian story with the same lame Australian humour. I didn't get into it at all. It's a true story though, and I guess that's why it got made. But it's just so tiresome and was a story that should have stayed in book form. As for the dog, he didn't strike me as entirely intelligent, not enough for the story to concentrate on only him.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[6]]<br/>It was nice enough, and the dog was great.  Definitely a good family movie.<br/><br/>I think the cliches were a deliberate part of the style of this film, but they really grated on me by the end.  I think the cliche of the characters would have been fine, but adding cliches in film making... someone says something in the bar and everyone immediately goes quiet, for example... made the whole thing really annoying.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br/>I agree that some parts of it may have been a little cliched. However, the story was delivered very much as a "yarn", complete with embellishments, therefore I think those aspects of it are quite forgivable.  Anyone who loves animals would also love this film. I had a cat who was a one-person cat, and I think the movie captured the human-animal bond extremely well. Hackneyed or not, I found it very moving!</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[3]]<br/>I felt uncomfortable from the opening frame of this movie and thought (mistakenly, as it turned out) that it would recede as the film found its feet. As a story it was great on ABC radio many years ago but it fails woefully as a film. Cliche upon cliche in Crocodile Dundee fashion made it painful to watch...which only goes to show that a star cast can't make a lemon taste of anything other than a lemon.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[6]]<br/>I found this movie a bit overrated. I would  liked to have seen more of Red Dog's adventures rather than about the charaters he encounters throughout his life.  Good visuals of Dampier and other parts of the top end of WA. Characters cliched, the fight scene between the cat and dog very silly and some stupid scenes regarding the shark. Some mildly funny bits, silly bits and sad bits. Loved KoKo though. My partner cried. 3 paws from me.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[10]]<br/>I really loved this film. It reminds me of the genre of Australian literature and film that is about tall tales and bull, coupled with larger than life characters, great humour and pathos, as well as an amazing insight into life in the Pilbara in the 70's. I am wondering if we are seeing the development of a 'West Coast genre" including Bran Nu Dae, both films based on true stories. <br/>If you have ever worked in the Pilbara or Kimberley, you have the advantage of more insight than your East Coast urbanites about remote area life.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[8]]<br/>Red Dog is charming. I am saying that even though I have lived with Koko's doppelganger (who's even more expressive) for 12 years, and I've read the book. Why did they leave out the hilarious real life incident when some locals mistook the vet's treatment of Red Dog's heartworm (carried out for convenience at the local pound) for unjust confinement and released him with bolt cutters? Happily Red Dog turned up back at the pound in to finish his series of injections. The fake romance is fine - but the story is even funnier in real life...</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[4]]<br/>I was very disappointed by this film. Beautifully shot, great potential in the story but it fails to deliver for me. It was trying so hard to be funny, it is very forced and over produced.  The combination of sentimentality with average cliched slapstick was careless.  There was no space for the real character of the dog to shine. It could have been done much more gently. Didn't move my heart at all.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[8]]<br/>Great film. Wasn't a massive fan of the small stories scripting but it linked together in the end. Some very funny moments and Koko was the star of the film. I loved it cause it wasn't a typical predictable Hollywood production. Yet it still delivered colour, larrikinism and authenticity in a film set against arguably one of the most scenic backdrops. Only people with short attention spans will not enjoy this film.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br/>I may be a little bias but this film was excellent to me. I grew up in Dampier and the stories of Red Dog are part of our history. this film actually captured the life and humour of the 70's in Dampier,particually with the odd characters that made up the community. It stayed true to the stories and understood why Red Dog was so loved. Its a classic Australian film that captured a very special part of our history without having to make it Hollywood.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[8]]<br/>A message to Andy who thinks " Red Dog" is the worst film he has ever seen - of course it's full of cliches, and in many ways quite silly, a joke if you like, Andy; but that is was why it was so clever and and so very entertaining, in my opinion. It was designed to take the mickey out of Australians and Australian movies in the seventies! And weaved into that 'sillyness' was the most wonderful, moving, true story of a dog who could teach us all a trick or two about loyalty and love.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[8]]<br/>I really, really liked it.  First, it was a pleasure to see a film where no-one is raped or stabbed or tortured or shot.   It is a beautifully crafted film and quite lovely to look at, and anyone who's been in the Pilbara or other outback mining community knows how typical the characters and the setting are.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[5]]<br/>This felt like aussie film has taken a step backwards. Production design &amp; cinematography disappoint. We found the characters formulaic, cliche and a bit annoying.  The human love story is nauseating and predictable &amp; is where it all falls in a bit of a hole. As passionate dog lovers we found the lighter, fun elements of the movie failed to counterbalance the truly painful aspects.  We really wanted to love this and didn't.</p>

No bad language, No raunchy sex, no unbelievable stunts, no carnage on the streets.  So maybe it was a bit over the top as far as cliches were concerned - so what!.  I like to be entertained and that is what this film did for me.. The cast was good and Ko-Ko "Red Dog" was unbelievable.  A good movie all round. Worthy of it's rating</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br/>I saw this with my three kids 10 to 4 years and this film was sophisticated enough to hold the attention of my 4 year old  and we all really enjoyed this film. <br/>I remember the Pilbara of these days as a young fella  - it is captured well; albeit a little simplisticly, stereotypically and superficially, and perhaps a little too kindly. However it struck the right note completely, lacking any pretensions and fully achieving its obvious aims: a light, uplifiting and entertaining film tugging at the archetypal emotions without being maudlin or syrupy. <br/><br/>Very like 'Strictly Ballroom' .</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[2]]<br/>Very disappointing. A reasonably interesting story "based on events which may or may not have happened ..." which could have been a good movie. Could have. I've seen better production quality on You Tube. The sound effects - a 750/4 with the cliche Harley overdub. The timelapse sunset - in the northern hemisphere. Zero emotion from the actors.</p>

The acting is completely unbelievable.   Perhaps we have become like Hollywood completely devoid of any creative instincts.   How could you both David and Margaret, ratings of 4 stars or more it is really beyond belief.   This is no cultural cringe; this film is bad, the characters one-dimensional, only the fine acting was from "Red" to counter this appalling emotional tripe.   Are we really such an undiscriminating audience that we could find this film acceptable?   No, not at all!</p>

Thirty years later they remerge to spruik the  family friendly values of a mining company? Let's get behind Australian films, for sure, but please don't repeat the mistakes of the past. The RED camera is an example of technologies that can help build a sustainable, indigenous  film industry. Let's get it right this time. Margaret and David please back the right horses</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[2]]<br/>This is the worst film i have ever seen.  It the most ham fisted cliched film ever to come from these shores.  The acting was completely unbelievable and left me with a feeling that perhaps this whole effort had been some cruel ironic joke.  It seemed to be an endless list of one dimensional characters.  Now I'm all for supporting Australian films, but not for supporting terrible ones.  Ive come to expect an extra star thrown in for an Aussie film, but ratings 4 star plus is really beyond belief</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br/>Really enjoyable mixture of comedy and tears. Beautiful Pilbara scenery and a great 70's soundtrack.There is nothing to dislike about this hour and a half of a true aussie gem.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[10]]<br/>Excellent Aussie movie, do not miss it. Fabulous scenery in a beautiful part of the country. The movie has sentiment, but is not a tear jerker. That claim is putting people off going to see it. This true story celebrates the bond between dog and human, a bond that is not broken but continues through loss and hard times. Wonderful acting, gorgeous kelpie and you will leave the cinema feeling good and with a smile. Great soundtrack.</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[2]]<br/>My God I must be a humbug!!! How I loathed this cheesy, manipulative, shockingly acted flick. The cliches are all in place (the Italian, the butch one who secretly knits) and the carefully placed groovy tunes to keep it all so "happy". The laughs are cheap. They should have made a doco. <br/>One star for the dog. He is absolutely beautiful and delivers the best performance..</p>

<p class="comment">((Red Dog))[[9]]<br/>At last, this has to be my film of the year. I was wondering if I was just getting too old or was this year full of very ordinary films. I have seen so many sombre films this year - and I was craving for something akin to bran nue dae - something to lift my spirits. This is it - a really lovely film.</p>
