<h2>Black Swan</h2>
<p><em>Review by David Stratton</em></p>
<p>THE RED SHOES meets REPULSION in Darren Aronofsky's wonderfully rich melodrama BLACK SWAN in which NATALIE PORTMAN proves she can act AND dance as Nina, who is cast, by demanding director Thomas Leroy, VINCENT CASSEL, in a New York Ballet production of "Swan Lake", when a veteran dancer, WINONA RYDER, drops out of the part. <br/><br/>Bullied by her very controlling mother, BARBARA HERSHEY, Nina is stressed out during the rehearsal period not helped by the knowledge that her rival and understudy, Lily, MILA KUNIS, is literally waiting in the wings.</p>
<h2>Further comments</h2>
<p>DAVID: Margaret, what did you think of this one?<br/><br/>MARGARET: I know that the reaction in Venice, everybody came out and they were bowled over by it and Aranofsky is a really interesting director. He won Venice a couple of years ago with THE WRESTLER and I thought I don't quite get it because she's mad at the beginning, she's mad in the middle and she's made at the end. Where is the character transition in this?<br/><br/>DAVID: I didn't see it like that at all, I must say. <br/><br/>MARGARET: I just felt a lack of tension in the character's relationship to everybody around her and within the film itself.<br/><br/>DAVID: It's interesting you thought that because I didn't find it like that at all. I thought there was quite a progression to her problem.<br/><br/>MARGARET: From mad to madder to maddest?<br/><br/>DAVID: Well, of her problems in the film. I just think it's a sumptuously made melodrama.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Oh, it really is. It looks good. I'm not denying that.<br/><br/>DAVID: Yes. And there's a lot going on. As it's taking plot elements from Swan Lake and kind of twisting them into this melodramatic backstage story. <br/><br/>MARGARET: In a way I thought maybe there's too much cleverness that's gone into trying to twist the plot without creating a sufficiently tense drama for me within what's happening now. I think there are so many good elements to this film. I'm nitpicking. I am nitpicking.<br/><br/>DAVID: You are and I'd never have too much cleverness in a Hollywood film, like in an American film, I can tell you.<br/><br/>MARGARET: I don't know. I think sometimes you can be over-clever and miss the point. Look, let me give it this three and a half stars. I want to give it three and a half stars.<br/><br/>DAVID: Well, you give it three and a half stars. I'm giving it four.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[8]]<br>I first saw this movie on the plane back from the U.S.,unfortunately 35 hours in transit caused me to fall asleep part way through!  However I caught it again on DVD.  I know this movie has polarized many..Personally I loved it and I thought Natalie Portman was great in this role as was Barbara Hershey as her pushy disturbed Mother..No wonder Nina was such a fragile character whose grip on reality was always tenuous!  It was such a demanding role both physically and emotionally for Portman and she pulled it off..it is a first-class psychological thriller !</br></p>

Another film where I ended up not caring about any of the self-absorbed characters and walked away wondering what the hell the fuss was all about. I just don't get it.

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[5]]<br>Yes it was quite sumptuously filmed but I found this a dishonest film.  I didn't think if had an internal truth.<br>Shocked that it won over films like "A separation", In a Better World, Of Gods &amp; Men, Melancholia and Tree of Life (ground-breaking films - stretching the boundaries), We Need to Talk about Kevin, How I ended this Summer, Mad Bastards, Buitiful, Fighter, Another Year, The Trip, Mrs Carey's Concert, Cave of Forgotten Dreams,Pina, and others</br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[2]]<br>What crap. It had me laughing it was so bad. Stuffing fluffy toys down the garbage chute and growing black feathers was a highlight LOL. I imagined it could become one of those films where the audience dress up and jump up in front of the screen to act out the scenes. It was so camp in its histrionics and completely farcical. Can't believe it's received so much hype. If you want to see genuine psychological thrillers then go to the man who wrote the book - Alfred Hitchcock. The only tension in this film is of the cartoon variety.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[0]]<br>Cliched? Ponderous?Pretentious? This film begs so many questions. Why was it made? Can Gen Y's be made to consume anything? Does this movie signal the end of critical thought? Can schlock masquerading as high art bamboozle even David Stratton? Sadly it has. I had to watch Carnival of Souls to remind myself what horror used to be like.<br>Attack of the Killer Tomatoes has been usurped!</br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[7]]<br>I was about 4 or 5 when I saw "The Red Shoes".  It was the second movie I'd seen after "The Wizard of Oz". Both terrifing movies for little children which is probably why I remember both so well after all these years. "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby" came much later. "Black Swan"  brings all four movies to my mind. It is real? It is not? Is she mad? Is she being bullied? At the end of this tense and beautifully danced movie, you know. If you are happy on the shifting sands of reality, you'll love it.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[0]]<br>Simplified overlong psychopop hipness masquerading as deep art-house melodrama. This is a pretentious bore exploring the alter ego of a woman suffering sexual hysteria and a bad mother. Lots of dark twists and clunky symbolism - this is no black swan just some indigestible chicken tikka.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[8]]<br>I really enjoyed this movie. Unfortunately I saw it with a whole bunch of friends who thought it was a cliche happy ballet flick and came out hating it. As a ballet dancer I was impressed by Portman's dancing, although you can definitely tell when they're using a body double.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[10]]<br>This movie was amazing, and I can tell you that I see it quite different to some of you. I feel that 'Nina' has been doing this for so long she has lost herself, and when she gets the role of the white AND the black swan she has to find herself again. To me the black and the white swan are the two halves of Nina, and she has to choose which one she wishes to be because the two can't survive in the same body. In the end it drives her to maddness and resolts in her death.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[9]]<br>Oh yes all good movies must have a character develop during its 2 hours, how realistic! Come on margaret,  it can be a bit  more subtle than that. This movie is one of those great ones that transcend art-house or commercial stereotypes and just tell an orginal tale in an original style. <br>He is an incredible director and as for Ms portman- she now has the throne.</br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[9]]<br>This was such a great film! It really grabbed me. Natalie Portnan's performance was stunning. I loved the intensity of this film. It was also quite disturbing, though, and I thought the sex scene was unnecessary. The disturbing scenes were very well made. The music was beautiful and really added to the dark tone of the film. I'm not much into ballet, but this was brilliant.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[8]]<br>She wants to be perfect for her mother. The dancing hardly matters. She has built nothing for herself. She has no character except the obsession of success. She can not express her spirit because she lacks one of her own. The character transition is that; in battling her demons she becomes something, she has something to express. Something dark and beautiful. But temporary. It is a simple story that deals with matters of life and death and the fragility of the human mind. My heart both raced and broke.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[1]]<br>OMG - I am avoiding anything that wins an Oscar from here on in - this was rubbish.  We had the on stage version of the Swan Lake, the offstage version of Swan Lake and a few more cliches tossed in for good measure - girl on girl action, French ballet director in New York (PAHLEASE!), mad mother who has stifled her little daughter.  Margaret is right - mad, madder maddest. It's all one note  - and Portman CAN dance, but I'm not sure she can act - there's a lot of angst but not much depth. AVOID</br></p>

It played in my mind long after watching it, and i think that's what makes a good film.. if it gives you all the answers at the end, but still leaves you .. thinking.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[10]]<br>A truly original, classic film. Beautiful, disturbing, sensual, frightening, sexual, melodramatic, intense, dark, over-the-top, funny, stylish, incredible! Such a rich text. No character development? Nina/Portman goes from repressed, fragile and harrassed, to disturbed and psychotic, to relaxed and dreamy and horny, to confident, sensual,  triumphant, yet ultimately tragic - the academy finally got best actress right with this one. A film about art, ambition, beauty, perfection and much more. Yes, it is OTT melodrama - so are Hitchcock's, Sirk's, Lynch's best films. I was utterly blown away. I love, love, love Black Swan!</br></p>

I have seen two other films in which the main character was required to fill the screen for the total running time of the movie and they were 'Chopper' and 'Il Postino'. An amazing example of the acting craft by Natalie Portman. The film deserved every award it received and them some!</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[9]]<br>Saw this for second time and it gets better. A classic movie. Those people who didn't get it should not have gone in the first place. Arthur and Gullivers Travels much more suitable for them. So don't be put off. If you enjoy cinema and you understand this movie is on the dark side then see it.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[0]]<br>Terrible. Absolute garbage. I laughed all the way through, for all the wrong reasons. Predictable. Clicheed. Tedious. Over-CLEVER??? This is SUCH an UNINTELLIGENT movie. As a B-grade horror/soft porn, it works fine. Black/white, jealousy, bulimia, self-harm, Winona Ryder with smudged mascara, OCD, et al,  in case we missed it the first time, the director repeats it again and again and again. And again. David, you didn't let Margaret get a word in, you were so taken in by the glitzy packaging. Compare and contrast to Rusty Crowbar in A Beautiful Mind. Now there is a film about mental illness.</br></p>

A film that's lacking in taste, direction and storyline which mendaciously tries to draw the audience into the mind of a ballet dancer who is a half wit to boot. <br><br>The violence is mind numbingly gratuitous and does nothing to add to the story. There's no real purpose to the movie except explore the depths of depravity a ballerina will go through to secure a prima ballerina role which would not have been given to someone as cuckoo as the protagonist.<br><br>Only watch it if you feel like stabbing yourself in the eyes with a pitchfork.</br></br></br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[10]]<br/>Fascinating film, I was glued to the seat until the very bitter end. Loved the photography, the dancing, the acting, the costumes, the music. A modern version of Swan Lake. Compelling how it shows the young girl trying to struggle free from all the dominating influences, but not having the strength to succeed stays true to herself with choosing death in preference to  becoming "evil" herself. Great to view with a friend or two, and engaged discussions afterwards makes it a great movie experience.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[6]]<br/>To be honest,  the development of Portman's character was a little stiff.  I was hoping at one point in the film that I'd feel sympathy for her. In saying that, I did love the art and presentation of the film. The music was beautiful in complementing the eerie, yet unsettling story. However, I don't think I'll ever see this film again. Not only was this film disturbing, I found it to be a little too basic. I was hoping for more of a twist, yet it never came.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[6]]<br/>i would have to say that Black Swan was an exceptionally well-made film in terms of movie-making tecniques, but the plot was too dark and even 'evil'. There was no progession or redemption of characters, and although it represents a fair view of the cut-throat world of ballet companies, i found alot of it unnecessary and shut my eyes alot. Plot: 0 stars Movie-making: 4 stars</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[1]]<br/>This sexually repressed, fragile, mommy dependent obsessive is a very sick little puppy from the off. Her artistic neuroses hardly matter though as she's fragmenting into a psychotic state even before she's asked by the paedophilic ballet director to "access her dark side". Yeah, yeah I get it - they all mirror the characters in the ballet and her rival is probably her alter-ego anyway.  The tension that should accompany the question of what is and isn't real is all by the by in a piece that's so OTT. I thought it turgid, melodramatic, pseudo-psychological guff! Liked the music.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[7]]<br/>I don't recall seeing any previews declaring this movie is about schizophrenia. It almost seems like many viewers have just made this assumption. It appears that Aronofky's goal is to allow us to make our own interpretation of the film. It would be boring otherwise!  My understanding is that the hallucinations and anxiety that Nina experiences arise due to the stress and pressure she feels to achieve perfection, and this ultimately leads to a potential eating disorder. I disagree with claims that suggest this movie is about schizophrenia and that Aronofky is attempting to mock the ballet industry.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[4]]<br/>Nina must master the seductive skills of the black swan, but she is actually a milquetoast, a white swan only. She cannot be a black swan in real life, so she hallucinates: grows fantasy feathers, becomes a fantasy killer. This enables her to dance up a storm. Trouble is, none of this amounts to seduction, unless you count masturbation as seducing yourself. She's sad, not tragic.  Tame sex, cardboard characters, creaky ending, too many mirror shots (yes, I got the visual metaphor). Loved the camera work , but the message of this film was: ballet drives you nuts.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[10]]<br/>A socially and sexually repressed young talented ballerina is dominated by her jealous mother who lives her life vicariously through her daughter, strives to achieve technical perfection but cannot express long suppressed emotions and translate them into her performance.  Her attempts to do so result in tragic schizophrenia when she  threatened by a rival dancer.  I was with Nina all the way during this film.  She was friendless, bullied by the director, and manipulated by her mother and her rival. Some filmgoers have disliked the sexual scenes.  I though they were important to show Nina's transition into the Black Swan.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[8]]<br/>SPOILER:  This film was not nearly as disturbing as i hoped it would be and everything just made too much sense for me.  When Nina started to transition, there was no real shock...shamefully, i almost laughed.  But the last few scenes are totally redeeming!  I was moved...i was in awe of Natalie Portman and her final transition into the Black Swan (in more ways than one).  One major problem though, was the first masturbation scene which seemed unrealistic, and served as a clear reminder that the film was directed by a man.</p>

With its soft porn, hopeless and unconvincing attempt at dancing by Natalie Portman, and the laugh-out-loud moments, I can't remember the last time I saw a film that was so over-rated.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[4]]<br/>The central premise of this film is that female sexuality is equated with 'evil' . Hence Nina's ditching of the fluffy toys and embracing of her age-appropriate carnal desires are paralleled by her transformation into the evil black swan. Rather a Catholic theme, wouldn't you say? I'm sure the pope would approve.<br/>The characters were 2 dimensional, lacking depth, believability and interest, the plot shallow and linear, and frankly I am surprised the director of something as wonderful as "The Wrestler" would sign his name to this pap.<br/>Two stars for cimenatography and costumes.</p>

Aronofsky gives plenty of visual clues about what is real/imagined so I don't understand people who couldn't differentiate the two. Visually spectacular, loved the hand-held camera work, giving us the sense of really being there. Loved it,Loved it LOVED IT!!!!</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[8]]<br/>Just watched this with my sister. No one warned us about the no 'holes' barred lesbian love scene. <br/><br/>Apart from hiding through that part, saying "Is it over yet???" I enjoyed the rest of the film. <br/><br/>The moral of this movie: If you have a sensitive artistic temperment, teetering on the brink of schitzophrenia, DON'T TAKE DRUGS! <br/><br/>Upon leaving this movie, we saw a nice old couple expecting to see a lovely film about ballet. I said: "Don't go in there! Don't do it!!!" It would definitely stop their pace-makers and make their dentures fall out.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[6]]<br/>Basically a well constructed drama - I enjoyed the ballet sequences and the borderline professional interplay. The problem I had with this movie is the central proposition that Portman can (or cannot) dance the black swan! Cassel's joy at the finale indicates that she has in fact succeeded, if terminally, but are WE convinced? Portman's dancing has not evolved perceptibly. I asked my daughter about this - she says Portman must remain somewhat limp to play counterpoint to Ryder or else the plot wouldn't work but for me the conclusion demands a standout "black swan" to balance her demise</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[9]]<br/>I really don't understand people who are complaining about whether what was happening on-screen was real or just the main characters' madness... I think that's  kinda the point. This movie is so great because it gives you Nina's perspective, and it is a bit chilling at times, but that's the point - her life becomes darker. It's not a Disney fairytale and I think you're kidding yourself if that was what you were expecting. A great film: full of adrenaline-gushing scenes and great discussions on the car ride home. Perhaps not to everyone's taste but a tremendous film!</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[1]]<br/>If people think this is a masterpiece, I really need an explanation as to why.  Yet another person about to win an Oscar for what should have been a made-for-tv movie.  I'm sure Valerie Bertinelli or Melissa Gilbert would have carried this nonsense (which is what it is), far better.  I read a review that said Michelle Williams while worthy, would not win the Oscar as many older Academy voters would deem 'Blue Valentine' unlikeable/unwatchable.  What do they think this is?  Singin in the Rain?  Half a star for what I thought was rather funny.</p>

Can you tell me one 'good' character in the movie, they were all so dark  - no balance at all.  Have wiped it from my memory as I know have most of my friends.  Whereas have just seen Rabbit Hole and that's a gem!  When I see a movie I like to be taken on a journey and I certainly wished I hadn't gone on the Black Swan journey.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[0]]<br/>That is the first time I have ever walked out of a movie.  I think it was just after the point where Beth starts stabbing herself in the face with a nailfile (or at least, that's what I assumed was happening from behind my hands!).<br/><br/>What was the point?!?  Gratuitous sex scenes and absolutely disgusting and creepy horror sequences... I thought the whole movie was a waste of time and utterly disgusting.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[7]]<br/>Interesting to read all these comments - my view is that it starts well but about half way through lapses into a surreal melodrama that doesn't work too well. It is a beautiful film visually, however - and the soundtrack is superb. A bit disappointed (aghast, perhaps?)  why some reviewers see the sex scene 'offensive' - surely these reactions are due to its homosexual nature and surely these reactions have no place in an open, diverse 21st century Australia.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[8]]<br/>Disturbing and tense viewing. Visually rich. The colour of Nina's clothes mirror her transformation. The story can be taken literally, however there are many other themes to unpack - mythology and archtypes galore. Also worthy of note is the sound production. Subtle but very effective in racking up the tension.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[9]]<br/>Darren Aronofsky has done it again, i.e. created a highly contentious film. Film is not always about realism. It is often about suspending your prejudices about what should and shouldn't be represented on screen. If you can do the latter, then Black Swan will be a spellbinding experience. I don't think I blinked through the final 15 minutes. Watch for Mila Kunis, who is probably the film's anchor. Natalie Portman has defined herself as an actor of substance in this role. Fascinating too is the connection with Aronofsky's other film about performance--The Wrestler.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[7]]<br/>The Red Shoes meets Repulsion indeed! Natalie Portman is a revelation in this, while Winona Ryder and Barbara Hershey don't get much to chew. From mad, madder to maddest? Yes, I think Margaret is right on the money here - there is no character transition in Black Swan (but) fasten your seatbelts, it IS a bumpy ride, frequently not for the squeamish. The hand held camera employed for the ballet  sequences makes this a visceral experience, balancing the more hysterical contortions of the plot and characterisations; it is beautifully filmed and realised. And kids, don't pick your cuticles!!!</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[8]]<br/>I thought it was great, was not what I expected, although I did go in without reading one review.  It depicted Ballet perfectly - pain and bitchyness. I thought Natalie Portman was brilliant; she definitely worked hard at creating a perfectionist with rather bad mental disorder. I loved how the whole movie ran through the theme of Swan Lake.  Beautifully shot. I loved the final scene. Overall a disturbing film which left me feeling a little off centre.  But isn't what a good film does and I'm still thinking about it days later.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[1]]<br/>What a truly awful film. I actually can't remember the last time I walked out of a movie, but I walked out of this one. It was ridiculous, unoriginal, sexist and utterly horrible. Anorexia and mental illness were portrayed as glamorous by the constant close ups of Natalie Portman's beautiful lips, eyes, skin and bone body etc. She was surrounded by every stereotype that could inhabit a NYC ballet set, and her descent from half balmy to completely psychotic was just unpleasant, predictable and distressing. Yuck.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[3]]<br/>I am a ballet and movie fan. Basically a good story that could have been great if it hadn't been for the sex scenes. I don't think the way the male dancers treater natalie portman was accurate either. Ballet is about fantasy, old fashioned fantasy not modern day smut. Don't bring a friend along it could be embarassing to see with friends. Those around me thought the movie was good but violent scenes in a movie are never good.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[8]]<br/>Saw on the weekend and was blown away. Haven't had a movie experience like this for long time, particularly an American relatively mainstream movie. Truly a psychological drama, modern and visceral.  Wasn't perfect, but certainly intense and thought provoking.  Fantastic take on young female sexuality, overwhelming mothers, shame, our corporeality and our revulsion of it. Mother daughter scenes, scene at hospital with Beth, reminded me of David Lynch style creepiness. Certainly not to be seen for light entertainment though.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[7]]<br/>One of the most highly anticipated films for me Black Swan didn't disappoint. I saw this after strong word of mouth from a wide array of viewers . The life imitating art story here is intricately told, beautifully composed and effectively shot. These robust production qualities are the backbone to the commited, consummate performance from Natalie Portman. She exhibits her ability to portray two disparate characters from one lead performance to outstanding affect. Certain elements of this film do remain a little cloudy, Something a second viewing will be sure to clear and appreciate even more.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[9]]<br/>Loved it - went in knowing it was a horror film - and sure enough it was. Aronofsky is nothing less than a visionary with Portman his muse for this engrossing movie. It was one of the most thrilling cinematic experiences i can recall for many years. Portman is the movie, despite creepy and solid support from Hershey and Kunis. Scary, exciting. daring and consumately made. A classic to be sure. Unexpectedly so.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[9]]<br/>A classic which most of the public reviews below dont seem to get. Brilliant performance from Natalie Portman she will win the Best Actress Oscar. But be warned this is not enjoyable cinema and is sinister and disturbing. But life can be like that too. So not a feel good movie but as a piece of cinema a masterpiece. Saw it 2 weeks ago and will see it again still cannot get it out if my head. Awesome.</p>

The less one knows about this icon of classical ballet, its history and psychology, the more one is likely to be persuaded that something that uses its name for marketing purposes might not quite live up to its name.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[4]]<br/>I think any regular ballet goer should be warned, this movie is not rated MA for nothing. It's for the horror audience only. There are scenes of an offensive nature plus others that escalate the ludicrous events. For starters, had the lead role been given to a principal who would have the technique, then there'd be no movie of course, and we could all have been spared the angst. Save your money and your sensibility.</p>

It is something like..out of Monty Python..without being even one bit...oh yes..it is one bit just a little funny.....stupid...stupid...stupid. Dancers generally don't have colligen lips and look haunted no matter the role.  Black Swan is all about technique not all that bloody melodrama.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[5]]<br/>very dark and scary but Portman irritated me-the frigidity was so over done it was hard to believe she would be cast as the black swan. but then i had to think the ballet director saw her intensity as potentially brilliant and that was borne out. The relationship with the mother was fantastically creepy ina Stephen King way. would have been brilliant if I felt more sympathetic towards Portman's character. the other dancer danced better.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[6]]<br/>I'm fascinated by how the feedback here started off universally positive, and now things have almost turned around 180 degrees. Kind of the opposite of how I felt about the movie myself - I was literally bored out of my brain for the first hour and then, all of a sudden, it actually got interesting! In other words, the movie was as schizo as the lead character. The acting is fine but reaches no great heights. And I was embarrassed by the hamfisted sex scenes - this'll be the last Aronofsky movie for me, I'm afraid. Very frustrating experience.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[6]]<br/>I thought Natalie Portman's performance was very good. I agree with the comments about it being difficult to know what was real and what wasn't, but thought that was intentional, to reflect Nina's state of mind.<br/>However, I like my endings to have some credibility and this was so ludicrous and unbelievably impossible it spoilt the whole experience.  I have no objection to the actual result, just the stupid way of getting there.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[9]]<br/>I really can't believe how divisive this film is. The acting performances are superb, I'm surprised Barbara Hershey didn't get any nomination. I think perhaps people didn't necessarily pick up on the message of the film about the dark and light binaries and the clever play on the themes of Swan Lake. Perhaps if you've seen Fight Club and a number of David Lynch flicks, some elements aren't overly new. Yet the almost European like realism crossed with the surreal elements was visually mesmerising and the tension palpable. There's also hidden imagery in the nightclub scene hinting at Nina's transition.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[9]]<br/>Apart from this being the film of the year. I think for me is that Nina always had schizophrenia or at least predisposed to it and it required a trigger for it to finally affect her in a very real way. So she was definitely mad to begin with but she had never been in a situation where the madness is fully realised. Throughout this film she wages war upon everyone but herself as mistrust and desire lead to paranoia and hallucination. Portman  portrays a grand-guigonol role,  Aronofsky references Fincher's Fight Club and kitschier Hitchcock. Winona Ryder plays herself :).</p>

The transition of the girl child woman wanting to be perfect for the mother and all else in the sheltered existence she has lead, creates the  paranoia that sets the scene in a highly competitive field.This film has all the elements of female mythology and the transition from being a girl to a woman. whore madonna good girl bad girl black and white.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[4]]<br/>I saw this film after having read several reviews and emerged shocked that none of them had recognised that both Nina and quite possibly her mother suffer from schizophrenia. My grand-mother suffered from this and having an insight into her possible experiences was extremely upsetting. Reviews do not capture how horrific and disturbing this film really is. I do not know what the film is trying to achieve given its vivid portrayal of such debilitating disorders which here seem to be left unacknowledged and untreated.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[6]]<br/>You thought watching this was disturbing??? Perhaps a taste of what it's like to be experiencing real psychosis, often exacerbated by drug-taking.  What's real? Did that really happen? Very frightening...even felt sorry for the damaged and naively damaging mother. Like that the director is trusting me to make my own musings about what actually happened.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[9]]<br/>I think the movie was almost perfect for what it, perhaps, intended. The movie was set up with Nina's perfectionist tendencies, given a twist by showing her obsessive tendencies, and then it was wrapped up by her apparent insanity. No questions were answered, no background was given, and overrall, the audience were left to make their own decisions. Much like a piece of experimental theatre, Black Swan was about the audience; left to decide their own version of Nina's history, and left to decide the reasons for her demise. I believe it works perfectly to ignite the audience's brainwaves.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[10]]<br/>Nina (Portman) is completely consumed with dance. She lives with her former ballerina mother Erica (Hershey) who exerts a suffocating control over her. Then Nina wins the lead in "Swan Lake" perfect for the role of the delicate White Swan but Lily (Kunis) is the personification of the Black Swan. Both dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship.<br/>With her mother living vicariously through her &amp; threatened by Lily whom is after the role. Nina Performs like it is her last performance.. Loved it, loved it, loved it!</p>

None of the characters are appealing, from the sleazy ballet director to the mad, ego-centric, narcissistic and needy ballerinas, not too mention the frightening mother.

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[10]]<br/>Absolutely wonderful in every way. Natalie Portman played the powerfully suppressed child fulfilling the needs of others beautifully and always "being perfect" -her inability to 'be perfect' for the director sent her into this terrible tailspin of self destruction. Her self destruction was gradual and powerfully played - first the skin, the anorexia, the physical overexertion and the final complete decimation of the person.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[7]]<br/>I've just seen Black Swan and after reading the comments made by Margaret I totally agree with her.  The movie was extremely well done and I was enthralled with Portman's acting ability (as well as her dancing).  But I found the intensity and the twisting of the plot sometimes made it hard for me to follow the movie. Please let us not forget Barbara Hershey.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[2]]<br/>Is it the glow of his previous films which has blinded so many to the fact that this film is  very amateurish, unconvincing and - yes - boring! Films are not made by flashy  cinematography alone -  where is the development of character and tension.... this film has neither.  It is also very exploitative -  using banal stereotypes and even a bit of lesbian sex to titilate those of us who were nodding in our seat...by the end it was diffucult not to giggle at the hysterically overplayed finale  .....how I wish I had chosen True Grit instead!</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[9]]<br/>Loved the black and white contrast throughout the movie - this was evident in so many ways - the story, the costumes...even the cleverness of the metamorphosis of the credits (visual and auditory)...yes worth staying for. This was the best film noir (pun intended) I've seen for some time and the descent into psychotic blurring of reality as good as what we saw in A Beautiful Mind. I've always enjoyed anything to do with Swan Lake and this added to its mystique. I'd bet Pyotr Ilyich would have applauded this 'adaptation'.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[4]]<br/>Cuedos to Natalie Portman who did a great job attempting to inject  light and shade into a character that was underdeveloped and over written along with an ensemble of cliched characters. I am with Margaret  on the mad, madder maddest comment.<br/><br/>Jerky handheld camera usage was unecessary and distracting.<br/><br/> I think SNL did the plot and film's depth justice with an appearance of Jim Carrey as the Black Swan. Check it out on utube. (Tho its only funny if you saw the film).<br/><br/>I loved  the Wrestler but Black Swan is a disappointing film. Heavy handed and banal</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[9]]<br/>An exquisite if very disturbing film about a psychologically vulnerable Nina pushed to the brink.  What I find most engaging about the film is that even though it is over-the-top and melodramatic in many ways, Nina's character is one whom deep down we can recognise in real life.  She is someone who struggles with identity, with being seen either as a child or a sex object, and seeking escape either by impulsive self-destruction or obsessive perfection in her art.  Slightly less handheld camerawork would be nice but it's a hard film to find fault with.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[0]]<br/>Parents be warned, do not let any budding ballerinas see this film! Natalie Portman's pained expression said it all for me. Maybe there was some good acting, but how would you know with the annoying hand-held camera that I wanted to constantly pull back from the actors. Dreadful lighting. Though in some scenes no lighting would have been an improvement! Too many shots of the back of Natalie Portman's head while she walked away. Pity she didn't walk far enough away from this film. Does Hoyts have a refund policy? Because I sure wasted my money on this one!!</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[10]]<br/>This is an absolute brilliant movie. Natalie Portman's performance is magnificent. . I think many people don't and won't understand this movie.  You are watching this movie through the eyes of someone who is suffering with paranoia schizophrenia.  As a mother of a person with this mental disease it is spot on.  It is hard to distinguish what is real and what is not in this movie, because, you sitting in the cinema watching this movie are "Nina".<br/>All performances are brilliant. I hope this one sweeps the Oscars. It is simplest one of the very best.</p>

The psychology was straight forward - I agree with Margaret about 'mad to maddest". Barbara Hershey was scary - a good advert on why NOT to get plastic surgery. The detailed Lesbian scene was unnecessary. Vincent Cassel was the most believable character. I was left feeling quite wrung out emotinally.</p>

While a psychologically thrilling movie can work well, personally thinking of 'A Beautiful Mind and even "The Sixth Sense' , I found some scenes surprisingly more gruesome than I was expecting.  While I can say it was a brilliantly performed film, I can't say that I enjoyed it, nor would I recommend it to others.  A disturbing experience.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[5]]<br/>Great acting from Natalie Portman, Winona Ryder &amp; Barbara Hershey however, they are the only good things which can be said.<br/><br/>The story was built around old hackneyed cliches, the physical demands of ballet excessively played out, the cinematography awful (shaky hand technique is like 20 years old) and most importantly, the depiction of Nina's neuroticism is so unrealistic. It doesn't reflect any actual medical condition, rather it is a pop culture depiction of what a mental disorder may look like. <br/><br/>The ending was just ridiculous even if there was supposed to be some sort of metaphoric meaning.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[9]]<br/>This is a terrific movie.  It is a wonderful instrument for the depiction of madness.  Similar in many ways to A Beautiful Mind.  Both Natalie Portman and Russell Crowe follow similar deteriorating journeys into the world of madness, carrying the audience with  them.  We are seeing the hallucinations with their (our) eyes and experiencing their delusions with their (our) minds.  No wonder so many people are being troubled by these experiences.  We are inside Nina's madness, as we were inside Dr Nash's (Crowe's) madness.  Go see it and understand what the life of people with psychosis is.  Absolutely brilliant.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[2]]<br/>Terrible. Nauseatingly unnecessary use of the hand-held camera, great acting by Portman and an interesting story line to depict a true psychopathic drama. But somehow I felt like a voyeur on this poor person's final descent into madness which is a  terrifying experience for a patient. It would have all been okay if somehow more respectfully treated. However, it was too sensationalised/ too Hollywood.  This is not the story of person overcome by a difficult role in a ballet but  of a severely damaged and sick person. A waste of money and time and I wish I'd never seen it.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[2]]<br/>Aronovsky seems to be in a groove of characters disintegrating, but Ellen Burstyn did it so much better in "Requiem for a Dream".<br/>After "Requiem" and "The Wrestler" This film was a huge disappointment.<br/>Natalie Portman doesn't have a thing going for her, but Barbara Hershey was fun.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[5]]<br/>This film could best be described as mediocre, and there is no way that Natalie Portman's performance is worthy of an Oscar. Yes, the visuals were great, and there were some beautiful close ups of the dancers' feet. It really made you appreciate the stress that their bodies are under. However, I found the "madness" over-the-top, and you really didn't identify with the characters at all.</p>

I've never been effected by a film like this, as I left the cinema nothing felt quite real. Seeing this film is like taking a journey through the looking glass- not necessarily pleasant but an absolute 'trip'.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[9]]<br/>((Black Swan))[[9]]<br/>Ms. Portman portrays the child-like innocence of the central character to almost perfection- which makes her descent to the dark, violent and devillishly glorious Black Swan all the more compelling. Ms. Portman deservedly received numerous awards for Best Actress for her best performance yet.<br/>(all the hostile critics should take a second to think of the context of this film before slanting the camera work which is deliberate by the way) This isn't just a melodrama but a repressed woman growing and spreadng her wings. One of the best films in my books.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[8]]<br/> A unique viewing experience. You never build rapport or even like any of the characters. The use of Swan Lake to build gut wrenching suspence in the finale is brilliant. The hand-held, jittery camera is overused, but overall it was a great movie going experience. You leave the cinema feeling dirty, a little grossed-out and very uncomfortable, which is awesome.</p>

The need to craft the perfect performance utterly consumed Nina, and her mental disintegration was captured beautifully by Aronofsky. The film juxtaposed beauty and horror as perfectly as Tchaikovsky's score. Simply wonderful. Bravo.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[8]]<br/>Nina: always the obsessive, methodical, technically obsessed dancer.  She knows it's the basis for putting her among the best, but can't quite let her feeling/instinct for what she loves support the technique that would make her the best.  Her director sees this.  He gives her a chance she craves. But the strain on her to achieve her ambitions is not something her psychological strength can manage.  Like her toe nail, too much pressure breaks it.

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[7]]<br/>I find it amazing that anyone thought it was too hard to figure out what was going on by the end.  I was annoyed that it over-explained too many things, too many lines in the dialogue were transparently utilitarian for the sake of making sure everyone gets it.  I think it's better to risk not totally getting everything 100% during the first viewing than to sacrifice the elegance of subtlety.  And I'm amazed that Margaret didn't find it tense enough.  Geez, how much more tension do you need?</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[8]]<br/>I thought the film was fantastic. Beautifully crafted. The way the film is shot really helps convey Nina's clostrophobic vision. The performances by Natalie Portman and Vincent Cassel are all Class.Aronofsky sure has it nailed. The Wrestler and now this? Fantastic. I thought he captured the pressure for a big stage show perfectly. I really don't know what people don't get about this film? Maybe they should hang out for fast and the furious 5. Not so much thinking required for that one.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[1]]<br/>Whoever thought up this film wanted to screw with the audience's mind.  It was too hard to understand whether she was imagining everything or whether it was real.  The horror elements reminded me of watching Freddie Kurger's films, very juvenile.  Natalie Portman has no expression in her face or eyes but her dancing was quite good.  I give it half a star because of the acting from Vincent Cassel who is wasted in this one.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[4]]<br/>Move over Sleepless in Seattle (or anything with Meg Ryan, really). Black Swan has taken a place in my list of ghastly movies. From the moment the creepy mandroid Barbara Hershey appeared, I was hoping someone in this film would die. A mish mash of melodramatic nonsense. There was little character development... nothing to engage with. Really don't understand what people liked here. Apart from the gorgeous frock Natalie wore at the Black Tie event, YAWN.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[4]]<br/>I gave it 2 stars for the fact that they had me watching the whole film. Sadly, for all the latitude I gave this film, it wore it's heart on it's sleeve, told us all the plot from the beginning and the only real tension was waiting for the director to be bold enough to take the leap. I was eagerly waiting for the duration of the movie for something other than the obvious, only to lament that I didn't follow my instincts and dismiss the film earlier. Bowed strings from start to finish does not a thriller make.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[9]]<br/>This movie is over the top, deliberately skewed, hamming the black and white contrasts, done beautifully.  Natalie Portman is brilliant as always.  My only reason for the half-star off is that the 'good girl' is a little too fragile, I could not see her convincingly being given the lead part. However the rest of it is superb and moving. My palms were sweating.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[9]]<br/>I also thought this movie was thrilling and captivating. If you strip it back, the basic premise is very simple, but the true brilliance is how the seemingly simple becomes complex and irrational in a complex and irrational mind. We're left not knowing exactly what was real, and what was imagined.<br/><br/>To me, none of the cleverness missed the point, and there was a relentlessness to being inside Nina's head that seemed frighteningly true.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[10]]<br/>Not since Polanski''s the 'Tenant'' have I seen such a mesmerising movie of someones journey into madness. Natalie Portman performance is amazing her facial expressions and body movements convey both her strengths and fragilities in equal measure. The film conveys her complex and varied emotions with limited dialogue and great visual beauty. It is a truly stunning and memorable performance. There are few directors that equal Aranofsky's insights into the human condition. This film will remain ensconsed in my memory for many years to come. I believe it will be compared to past masterpieces such as ''Psycho'', ''Repulsion'', etc.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[9]]<br/>Psychologically gripping, clever and completely engaging.<br/><br/>Nina is trapped in the little-girl ballerina cage of her bedroom and persona. Repressed, virginal and chained to perfection. Her controlling mother has shaped and pushed her daughter to become what she had dreamed of being; keeping the keys both physically and mentally. Until Nina's spectacular flight. A skilful interweaving of the melodrama of the ballet into the mind and life of Nina. A Hollywood film that for once isn't 'Hollywood'.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[9]]<br/>SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!<br/>So much of the power of this film lies in its mythic depth, its blurring of imagination and reality, and its demand that we see beyond its deftly rendered surface to the awful beauty of the humanity beneath.  It may be melodramatic on the surface, but its also replete with symbol.  When Nina surrenders to the emergent black swan, realises she has killed a youthful self, before "dying" [not literally]  to complete the transformation, she enacts a myth that'll have the Jungians and other soul workers cheering.  Don't take anything literally and you too may be transformed, as I was!</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[9]]<br/>This film shocked me to the core - such was its brilliance.  The opening was magnificent, it nearly brought me to tears. Portman was heartbreaking, sumptuous.  The filmmaking was perfect, gritty, stark, draws you right in to this dancers obsession.  Of course, the music is to die for. The horrors are unexpected, but keep your eyes open, you won't wont to miss a second of this.<br/>Of course, you are told from the opening how it's going to end, but the journey....I can only admire filmmakers that are brave enough to do this - it renews my love of cinema.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[4]]<br/>I've just arrived home from seeing this film and I feel as if I've been through the wringer. The hand-held camera work at the beginning (or was it all the way through?) made me feel sea-sick and the violence made me feel queasy.  I'm not even sure I understood what it was all about.  Have to go and have a lie-down, a cuppa and a Bex.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[6]]<br/>I cannot see how either David or Margaret say this is sumptuous. It is gritty, grainny and at times washed out. Not to mention the continually moving and spinning handheld camera work (what has happened to David's usual complaint about this).<br/>The story of Nina's unravelling mental state is quite interesting. Natalie Portman's performance is superb. Mila Kunis as Lily is also quite good but I thought Barbara Hershey's possessive mother just too over the top.<br/>Good story that could have been better done.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[4]]<br/>SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!<br/>I cringed in every scene of this movie and I was on the verge of leaving the cinema because I thought I was about to throw up! It was highly disturbing and extremely explicit. Natalie Portman was fantastic,Although the character she portrayed was very unpleasant to watch. From those nasty scratches on her back to the sound of her cutting her nails and a pedophile teacher and "friend" feeling her up. I spent mosty of my time with my eyes covered by my shirt then actually watching this film.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[0]]<br/>Worst movie I've seen in ages.  Definitely in my top 100 stinkers of all time.  Hand held camera made me feel dizzy and I had to keep closing my eyes to have a little rest from all the frenetic movement on the screen.  I also found it boring, in spite of all the obvious effort and expense that went into making it.  I felt claustrophobic nearly all the way through and barely restrained myself from running out of the cinema.  May a professional dancer would have helped it.  Am amazed how many people liked it!  I agree with Mal.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[5]]<br/>The main character just seemed to whimper and whine. It didn't make sense that she would be picked for the role, when there were better dancers. I found Natalie Portman's performance emotionally unbelievable and annoying. A serious frown does not make a dancer or a troubled soul. There were some wonderful effects and the idea was good, but poorly excuted. I think Maragaret was right in the film trying to be too clever. Would recommend it only to males, who will enjoy the girl on girl without it being R rated.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[9]]<br/>Black Swan is a visually stunning film with very dark and at times terrifying themes. Use of some very interesting and clever camera techniques told the story of this melodrama perfectly, and what a great story it is too. The film really captures the competitive and perfectionist nature of professional ballet and Natalie Portman was incredible; this will definitely be her Oscar-winning role. Enthralling from start to finish, this is a must-see.</p>

I felt the characters themselves were really flat. Apart from nina's rival, she was the most real. scenes didn't add anything to the movie except more confusion. <br/>Also, are ballerinas abused by their teachers just to bring out their emotions for the show?<br/>I was left feeling very frustrated and very unsatisfied by the movie.<br/>Having said all that, Natalie's acting was brilliant and that last dance scene of the black swan was mesmerizing. My stars are given for them alone.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[9]]<br/>I was enthralled by Black Swan. There's much in there thematically but for me primarily it's a powerful exploration of the how perfectionism can lead to self-destruction. The protagonist is a repressed, parentally-abused ballet dancer who is lacking in healthy self-esteem. I think she has an emptiness inside; a self-loathing. She copes by covering up her emptiness by obsessively seeking perfection in her performance of her art... with tragic consequences. Having lead a life of Apollonian structure, this character is not emotionally-equipped to deal maturely  with the Dionysian forces required for the Black Swan ballet role. Triggering, gratifying, tragic. <br/><br/></p>

Having said this, it is an extremely original film, containing elements of horror, violence, fantasy, sex and drama. Even a touch of comedy but not much. For someone who is not a fan of ballet, I found this intriguing and very well made. I think Natalie Portman was very good; however other actors may have done even a better job.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[8]]<br/>Dark, beautiful and thoroughly engrossing, Black Swan really gets under your skin. It will be derisive, as Aranofsky's movies usually are. <br/>Portman's natural beauty and fragility are a great fit for the disturbed Nina. A great Oscar worthy performance. Barbara Hershey (with her now strange looking face) as the creepy, controlling mother is another fine performance from this under-rated actress.<br/>Black Swan is a must see, even just for some of the unintentional laughs on offer here.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[5]]<br/>Er...  David's comment that it is a sumptuously made melodrama, Margaret responds, "It looks good, I'm not denying that."<br/><br/>How could anyone say that this film looks good? Grainy, handheld, in your face, digital that looks very digital -- a lot of light that looks stark and unflattering, it's ugly. It's gritty and raw.<br/><br/>So when David says sumptuously made, what's he on about too? Perhaps he just means sumptuously constructed storywise, because if they both seriously think it's a beautifully shot film, it's THEY who have lost their marbles and are hallucinating!</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[8]]<br/>Works as a female coming of age tale and an essay on perfectionism and obsession. I found the over the top, in your face style to be somewhat a replacement for what could have been further development in both plot and support characters, such as the mother, the rival and the boss.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[10]]<br/>'Black Swan' is really a brilliantly executed horror film with dashes of high camp hysteria. Argento's 'Suspiria', Polanski's 'Repulsion' and Powell &amp; Pressburger's 'The Red Shoes' are all in here! It's both delicious and disturbingly good. Natalie Portman gives it her all - and is absolutely unforgettable...</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[5]]<br/>No you're not nitpicking, Margaret. I didn't enjoy this, although I liked aspects of it.<br/>I felt insulted by the lack of subtlety (ok, so it's a melodrama - really?).  The metaphors are dense and relentless, although sometimes compelling. For the simplicity and predictability of the 'real life following art' story and characters, and the way I felt after seeing it - one star. But I guess, Natalie Portman, who I normally enjoy as an actor, did a good job because now I'm struggling to like her - to see past the brittle, lifeless creature who dominated the film.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[6]]<br/>I'm with Margaret on this one.  I found it excessive in almost every department.  I enjoy a good melodrama and if it's set in a theatrical background I'm prepared for it to be over the top but here the melodrama was layed on with a trowel.  I foound its excesses more alienating than engaging.  If you use 'The Red Shoes' as a benchmark for this kind of exercise, this film just isn't in the same league</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[10]]<br/>Not since 'Repulsion' have the inner workings of a deranged mind been so graphically realised.  Aronofsky puts us constantly at Portman's back, seeing the delusions through her eyes and this is a journey which leaves the audience shocked and drained.  CGI comes of age - there are set pieces of pure magic here which serve to enhance the vision-an intoxicating blend of dance and delusion.<br/>Portman is sublime with the best female performance of the year and the film is not only the year's best but which belongs in film world's top drawer.</p>

I thought it a brilliant psychological thriller, wonderfully performed by all, notwithstanding Natalie Portman's amazing portrayal of a disturbed ballerina - a role she should win an oscar for. I thought it full of tension from beginning to end. A truly outstanding film from a genius of a film director.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[9]]<br/>an almost perfect film for me. As a parent of dancers, I felt that this film perfectly captured the immaturity and anxiety of the life that Nina was living, and the competitiveness and manipulativeness of the ballet world that leads to immense self doubt, obsessive/destrutive behaviours and often little happiness. I found Natalie Portman very believable as she made the transition to the black swan. will definitely hae to watch again</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[10]]<br/>Like Swan Lake itself, and like all good fairy tales, it's much more horror story than anything else: the story of the wicked doppelganger, the harbinger of ruin and despair - and how much more horrifying when that doppelganger is actually just a splinter of yourself? I thought it was not only a great film, but the truest interpretation of the ballet itself I've ever encountered. And for someone who started her training in earnest in her late 20s, Natalie Portman was astonishingly convincing as someone who's been doing this all her life.</p>

Because if it happened when she hallucinated the scuffle with Lily, then she proceeded to make it through the last half of the ballet with a mortal wound. Which seems unrealistic.<br/><br/>A thoroughly enjoyable film and Portman is truly brilliant, but the expression of her madness just didn't make any sense for me.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[8]]<br/>I'm not a fan of ballet, I may not get it but this film brought out something that is common in movies such as this, which is the struggle to achieve perfection in your ability. Natalie Portman was extremely effective in this, and the film paces very well in her nightmare to eventually become this Black Swan character, and the price she pays to do so. The film is beautiful, the colours gorgeous and is well worth a viewing.The ending in itself brings out a metaphor for what it takes to achieve perfection. Dazzling.</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[9]]<br/>I am a very big fan of Aronofsky's work, I find that he deals with our 'inner demons' in a very passionate and of course at times very dark way. Having recently watched 'Pi' for the second time I have to say I was very pleased to see that on his latest work 'Black Swan' he deliciously takes us yet again on another emotional rollercoaster ride. Excellent film !</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[10]]<br/>I agree with Dr_Omega. Nina's transition from white to black is obvious. I can see how Margaret could read into the 'mental-illness-factor' as a major theme, however there is so much more going on in Aronofsky's narrative that she may not even realise. This film needs atleast 2 viewings. I thank Aronofsky for his courage to combine arts forms, using intertexuality between the Swan Lake and Nina's world is just brilliant! Conceptually  - this IS a 5 star flim. No question. Aronofsky really handles Black Swan's complex darkness with ease; like a magician (at times) alluding his audience. Bravo!</p>

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[9]]<br/>Nina DOES transition, though, as the story mirrors that of Swan Lake. Initially, she IS the Swan Queen. She's frigid, nervous and unsure of every facet of her being besides her beauty. The transition is obvious as she embraces her dark side. More than once she expresses a desire to be free from the boundaries her mother has set for her, and acts accordingly.

<p class="comment">((Black Swan))[[8]]<br/>I caught the film last night and would have to say that it's Aronofsky's most accomplished and passionate film yet.
