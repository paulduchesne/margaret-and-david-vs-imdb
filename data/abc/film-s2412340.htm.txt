<h3>Australia</h3>
<p class="ratd"> Rated <em>M</em></p>
<p><em>Review by David Stratton</em></p>
<p>In 1939, Lady Sarah Ashley, (NICOLE KIDMAN), travels from England to Australia’s Northern Territory where her husband, Maitland, has been running Faraway Downs, the only cattle station in the Territory NOT owned by the powerful ‘King’ Carney, (BRYAN BROWN).<br/><br/>But Maitland is dead – apparently murdered by tribal aborigine King George, (DAVID GULPILIL). The old man’s grandson, Nullah, (BRANDON WALTERS), lives on Faraway Downs in constant fear of being taken away by the authorities.<br/> <br/>After firing untrustworthy station manager Fletcher, (DAVID WENHAM), Sarah, determined to frustrate Carney’s scheme to buy Faraway Downs at a rock bottom price, enlists the help of The Drover, (HUGH JACKMAN), to drive her cattle to Darwin.<br/><br/>Baz Luhrmann’s long-awaited romantic epic, handsomely photographed by Mandy Walker, is a sweeping, rather old-fashioned, adventure which climaxes with the Japanese attack on Darwin.<br/><br/>At the outset, the director’s trademark theatrical approach to the material – a very heightened form of reality which worked well in a very different context in STRICTLY BALLROOM and MOULIN ROUGE – is a bit grating.<br/><br/>What worked in interior situations in those films seems glaringly intrusive in a realistic outback setting, and there’s a forced jocularity to the scenes in which the main characters are introduced. Some of the actors seem uncomfortable with this approach, although young BRANDON WALTERS, a real find, is blissfully unaffected. <br/><br/>But after about 20 minutes, with the start of the cattle drive, the film settles down and the actors come into their own. <br/><br/>Happily NICOLE KIDMAN and HUGH JACKMAN are genuinely romantic leads and the terrific supporting cast, which includes JACK THOMPSON as a drunken accountant, TONY BARRY as an outback policeman and BEN MENDELSOHN as an army officer, are mostly magnificent.<br/><br/>AUSTRALIA seems squarely aimed at an overseas audience; not only does it keep referencing THE WIZARD OF OZ, but its approach to the Stolen Generations is superficial.<br/><br/>Plot points are repeated unnecessarily and melodrama constantly threatens to swamp the production, though it’s mostly kept under control.<br/><br/>It’s not the masterpiece we’ve been waiting for, but AUSTRALIA is still an ambitious, at times even awesome, movie experience.</p>
<h3>Further comments</h3>
<p>DAVID: Margaret?<br/><br/>MARGARET: It isn’t the great film that we had hoped for but there are some lovely elements to this. I think it is quite the loveliest I have seen Nicole on screen and, you know, it’s sort of like she is a romantic lead, you know.<br/><br/>DAVID: Yeah. It’s good to see her in this sort of part. <br/><br/>MARGARET: And she’s rarely played that role, actually. Brandon Walters is fabulous. I mean he is just the heart of that film and actually is the thing that brings a tear to your eye at the end and I think Hugh Jackman is a gorgeous romantic lead on a horse. You know, he’s also stunning.<br/><br/>DAVID: But I think almost all the supporting cast are great, too. I mean there’s terrific...<br/><br/>MARGARET: What I minded about that is that because Baz directs in an operatic style, you know, which you didn’t mention his best film, which is ROMEO AND JULIET, you know, and that style is perfectly suited to that material. <br/><br/>But, you know, opera is done in broad sweeps, you know, and so you have stereotypes and caricatures and that’s what I think this film lacks. I think the characters lack substance and so in that way - and I think it’s full of clichés, the film, in a lot of ways.<br/><br/>DAVID: Well, I think the other thing that you haven’t said is that Baz obviously in all his films is clearly influenced by Hollywood of another era and he said this is sort of a GONE WITH THE WIND type thing. <br/><br/>And obviously there’s elements of that in the way the characters are drawn. Yeah, I mean the cattle baron played by Bryan Brown comes straight from a Hollywood western. <br/><br/>It’s not, I would think, an authentic sort of Australian character and there are a lot of Americanisms really in the film. Even the way that the Australian flora and fauna is depicted is not the way, probably, you would expect it to be depicted in an Australian film.<br/><br/>MARGARET: But there’s more substance to Scarlett O’Hara and Rhett Butler, you know, in 10 minutes of GONE WITH THE WIND than there is to the characters. You know they are really just romantic leads. <br/><br/>And the only other thing that I would say about this film is that it is profligacy in filmmaking: an extraordinary shooting ratio, whichever way you count it. <br/><br/>A lot of money has been spent on this film and for the amount of money I think we might have expected something a little bit more. And to tell you the truth, I think it would benefit from a longer version, because there are some events in here that don’t make any sense at all.<br/><br/>DAVID: I agree with you. I would be very happy to have seen a three or three and a half hour film, actually.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Yes.<br/><br/>DAVID: Which would have teased the material out.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Yes.<br/><br/>DAVID: Because I think it is a bit perfunctory at times.<br/><br/>MARGARET: It seems somehow compromised.<br/><br/>DAVID: Yeah, a little bit. But I must say, in the end, with all its faults, and it certainly has faults, I really enjoyed it. I mean the last half of the film I think is terrific and I really had a good time with it.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Oh, I like when it goes into the muster. Romantic mode. the cattle muster. I’m giving it three and a half stars. I mean I hope people embrace it.<br/><br/>DAVID: I’m giving it three and a half too and I hope people embrace it as well.</p>

<div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">23/12/2008 5:58 PM</em><em>Name</em>: Kirstie Williams<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars6.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Australia is a film that although beautifully shot, and includes some history- fails as a historically based movie but succeeds as a passionate love story between Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman.<br/>The casting of Nicole Kidman in place of an authentic British woman was a noticeable mistake that created a 2D caricature like woman, whose accents and accentuated mannerisms were cringe worthy.<br/>Hugh Jackman was great, as was Brandon who narrated with clarity and honesty. The film certainly is an emotional journey that would not sit well with skeptics, but is an enjoyable watch for any lover of romance. </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">23/12/2008 1:19 PM</em><em>Name</em>: Rob<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars1.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Not made for Australia<br/><br/>Love Nicole, love Hugh, love Baz - but hated this.<br/><br/>As Australia awakens into its new order where we are mature enough to say Sorry we are shaking off the shackles of everything this film says we are.  <br/><br/>If this was supposed to be escapism, then it failed. It was like sitting down to hear the same old story that granma has told you over and over again.<br/><br/>No doubt the overseas markets will lap it up believing that kangaroos still roam wild in the streets of Sydney - but this movie was not made for AUSTRALIA.<br/> </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">21/12/2008 2:19 PM</em><em>Name</em>: Suzanna<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars6.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: I found all of the characters shallow - more like caricatures than believable people.  Nicole Kidman's opening scenes were cringe-worthy; she was impossible to take seriously.  However she improved later in the film, particularly her scenes with Nullah.  I blame Baz Lurhman, not Kidman or the other characters, for the cliched characterisation. <br/><br/>The stars of the film were the Australian landscape, David Galpilil and of course Brandon Walters.  To my suprise I was even moved to tears in the final scenes, although the pat ending was so predictable.<br/><br/> </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">21/12/2008 12:48 AM</em><em>Name</em>: Martin<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars7.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Having read peoples comments I am surprised at how many measure the film's success on how realistic it is.I got much enjoyment and entertainment from how this story was portrayed. I thought one of the highlights was Nicole's early conversation with  Brandon Water's, where he asks her to sing. I thought it was a really funny and touching scene. I was put off by some recurring character traits like Wenham's "hmmmm" idiosyncrasy. I also was a little distracted by many close ups being obviously shot in a studio, as the light didn't match with the wides.  </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">19/12/2008 2:18 PM</em><em>Name</em>: Roger<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars3.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>:  Much too long. It's old fashion cornball. A lot of fake looking computer graphics,  And the story, crikey! talk about schmaltzy. It starts off as a 'Blazing saddles'/'Crocodile Dundee' style shtick, then goes comedy/drama, like 'Oklahoma' without the music.Then it goes all out drama like 'Gone with the Wind', with loud, epic music and smoke everywhere. And this moronic  'The Noble Mystical Aborigine' theme, where an old 'blackfella'  magically appears. Jeez!  If you liked 'The Robe' or 'The Ten Commandments', you might like this. . The critics are right, this will bomb. </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">19/12/2008 10:16 AM</em><em>Name</em>: Gordon<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars0.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: I fully support Sallys comments and rating. What a dog of a movie. It will go down as one of the worst Australian movies of all time, and might well be the end of Kidmans career. I absolutely hated this movie. </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">18/12/2008 8:20 AM</em><em>Name</em>: Nancy Patton<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Baz needs to know that ordinary folk like me absolutely love his movie.He told a story and as the Drover, and the aborigines, say, one's story is most precious.  My friends who won't go see it because it is "not historically accurate" don't know what they are missing. It is a wonderful cinematic experience. You two (Margaret and David) did your job as critics as fairly as possible, but some comments below had me gobsmacked. How virulently extreme!  </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">16/12/2008 6:52 PM</em><em>Name</em>: Sally<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars0.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: As I was curious about this movie I went to see it today. What a huge disappointment! The dialogue was appalling and the characters were embarrassing caricatures. The acting was terrible and I couldn't wait for the whole experience to end. I was also bitterly disappointed with the cinematography. I felt they could have done a much better job of showcasing our beautiful scenery. Altogether a totally unbelievable movie. I wanted to walk out after about twenty minutes but decided to stay until the end. I shouldn't have bothered. </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">16/12/2008 6:16 PM</em><em>Name</em>: Maurice<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars1.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: OK the scenery was good but thats all.The story was like a pantomine , the lead actors name is Drover ,because he is a drover ![cringe cringe] . <br/>People I have spoken to about the film feel they must be kind and mention the good scenery shots because the film is about Australia. I would never bother watching another film directed by Baz Luhrmann. Any real farmer would see the huge difference to reality! </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">16/12/2008 3:01 PM</em><em>Name</em>: James<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars2.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Possibly the worst film I've seen all year - its either this or Mummy 3.  The bemusing opening set the tone for what was a dreadful mishmash of tourist advertising, sombre reflection on the stolen generation, 'comedy' and melodramatic romance - all of which, I might add, were done well.  The acting was mostly poor due to direction and a poor script I would think.  I thought Wehman was as cringe-inducing as Kidman and Brandon Walters was nothing special. 'Australian English' was used very clunkily.  One Star for the scenery, which was the only reason to watch, in the end. </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">15/12/2008 10:31 PM</em><em>Name</em>: Babyluca<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars7.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: enjoyed the film. Disappointed in Nicole Kidman role. I feel a "real life" British actor would have been better. I remember Chips Rafferty in the 'Overlanders" and others like 'Sons of Matthews" great Aussie movies. This is not one of them.Brendon Walters great.Overall an enjoyable movie but not a memorable one.  </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">15/12/2008 8:57 PM</em><em>Name</em>: Tariba<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars6.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Mixing the Kimberleys and outback Qlds is cheating and the Stolen Generation bit did  no credit for the Stolen Generation  - it was out of context with the film.  Pity the direction could not have been better and the stereotyping far less.  I enjoyed it but was still disappointed. </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">15/12/2008 5:51 PM</em><em>Name</em>: Sandy<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars8.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: I expected a dud but I was in for a surprise. I loved it. It is hugely entertaining. All you need to do is suspend disbelief and settle in for a rollicking cliche-packed narrative ride. I also expected Nicole Kidman to be a dud but I was in for another surprise. She was good. And Hugh Jackman...well, he sure has the X-factor. And Brandon Walters as the little boy almost stole the show. However, the real showstopper is the landscape. It is awe-inspiring.<br/><br/> </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">15/12/2008 2:38 PM</em><em>Name</em>: Kaye<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars3.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: The stars are for the scenerie and Brandon Walters acting ability.  Nicole Kidman was dreadful, Hugh Jackman looked uncomfortable.  He was a mixture of Errol Flynn, John Wayne and Adam Sandler and Brian Brown was embarrassing.  Baz should stay in America where they may appreciate him he has no idea of Australia or Australians.  Every cliche and soppy, unrealistic moment we have ever seen in every Amercian soapy type movie was used in this movie.   Dreadful rubbish. </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">15/12/2008 2:01 PM</em><em>Name</em>: Stolen?

We were invaded &amp; not one single Government since the war has bothered to tell us.<br/>I guess, we can all take a work of embellished fiction  every now &amp; then but, when it gets sold around the world as fact, then that is just plain wrong! When you consider a film like Forrest Gump that skirted around historical events in a fun, lighthearted way, I wonder how much better a film like this could have been.<br/>At the end of the day, the truth sadly must have less of an appeal to cinema goers than propoganda. </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">15/12/2008 1:38 PM</em><em>Name</em>: David<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars0.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: --Longer!? --good grief! <br/>I thought it  unendurably embarassing at  its present length. Those who haven't enjoyed it seem to be condemned as unpatriotic but I think such a presumptious title deserves  much better. I believe we have the talent to have done this and it does seem that the trust and funds our industry so need have been squandered in this half baked film. I believe the New Yorker review is probably the best I have read and I commend it to you both. </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">15/12/2008 12:02 AM</em><em>Name</em>: Di<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars8.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: This movie has Baz written all over it.  I was a little unsure with Nicole as the romantic lead for a few minutes until I began to enjoy the humor of it all.  Mostly, I had fun watching this film.  I would see it again. </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">14/12/2008 11:05 PM</em><em>Name</em>: joshua richards<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars4.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Devoit of any realism what so ever, sorry Baz but this one is a bit of a bummer. </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">14/12/2008 10:51 PM</em><em>Name</em>: Rob<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars7.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: I thought the movie was better than I expected. Enjoyed Kidman only since Moulon Rouge.  Kornie for the most part, but fun..... </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">14/12/2008 7:43 PM</em><em>Name</em>: POPPY<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars6.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Maybe I've been exposed to too many excellent special effects but I cringed at this film's efforts:  the ships, the cattle on the ridge.  As a melodrama it was wonderful.  Wanted to cheer &amp; clap when the cattle didn't stamped off the ridge.  Excellent makeup on Jack Thompson after he'd been trampled.  But the music ... also those climactic endings, then another plot line.  It did look like a tourist ad at times.  I got bored with the endless close ups of Nicole &amp; Jack &amp; David &amp; Brandon - who has amazing eyes, an actor to watch. </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">14/12/2008 7:23 PM</em><em>Name</em>: john<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars9.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Dear D&amp;M,<br/><br/>I usually agree with you but I would give this 4.5. I think that this film is not about Hugh and Nicole, but about Baz engaging squarely with the stolen generation and aboriginal Australia, and how it meets English settlement. As you say it is 'operatic' and I would go so far to say that it is almost an aboriginal musical..<br/><br/>Perhaps that this is too obscure, but I was so surprised that I loved this film, and it went far, far deeper than the marketing, or your review actually goes.<br/><br/>not accustomed to writing reviews,<br/><br/>John </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">14/12/2008 7:14 PM</em><em>Name</em>: Emma Pritchard<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars8.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: While Australia wasn't the film I expected, I was far from disappointed with it. I think Brandon Walters was fabulous, definitely the brightest and most natural child actor I've ever seen and for a first time performer...wow! Baz did a wonderful job in capturing the humour of the Australian outback and the scenery is breathtaking. The film captures the beauty of the country perfectly. Kidman did a fairly good job and Jackman was brilliant, he made the role of Drover his own.  I can't call it the best film I've seen but I still loved it. </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">13/12/2008 12:38 PM</em><em>Name</em>: feline<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars2.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Four screenwriters - no surprise the script seems to have been developed by a committee - disconnected with confused themes. Darwin was bombed badly over a couple of years but there was no Japanese landing on Australian soil. The first half hour was  caricature and the rest of the film was full of cliche - even one of my favourite actors David Wenham was a bit OTT. But Nicole Kidman actually surprised as she became involved in the droving, the best I've seen her. Full marks for costumes and hairstyles and Hugh . </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">13/12/2008 11:49 AM</em><em>Name</em>: SjW<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars7.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Kununurra has been abuzz with 'The Movie' for the past year so we've all awaited its release with vested interest and emotion.  Nearly everyone was involved in the event: as extras, set production or brushed with stars in our local cafe.<br/><br/>The movie was quite good, although characterisation was one-dimensional and depiction of the landscape didn't come close to true splendour.  The cultural element was quite well done and Nullah shone.  Where was the music?<br/><br/>Best part was the screening at our local outdoor picture theatre with 100 other locals as a lightning storm played across the horizon synchronised onscreen.  Special. </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">13/12/2008 1:34 AM</em><em>Name</em>: greenpossum<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars6.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: It's not a masterpiece and frankly the typical Luhrmann treatment doesn't suit the material. So many cliches, but at least the film doesn't take them seriously. For a grand title like Australia, you might expect something less provincial (sorry, NT). It tries to be PC too, laudable, but just another reason it's all over the place.<br/><br/>Aside from that, I didn't mind and I didn't cringe, but it's not one to collect. </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">13/12/2008 1:11 AM</em><em>Name</em>: havachatkiwi<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars0.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Most boring film I have seen in a while.  Way too much digital enhancing with the plot jumping all over the place.  Just as I thought it was about to end it started up with more.   Nicole Kidman's acting was not the best,  Hugh's role was humourous but really that's about it.   I won't be recommending it to those who ask what I thought of it.  A dud! </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">13/12/2008 12:11 AM</em><em>Name</em>: Motya<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars2.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: David - your principles! </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">12/12/2008 9:11 PM</em><em>Name</em>: Wyn Richards<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars8.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Australia is fairy tale, in Lurhman's trademark fantastical, flambouyant style. People who are looking for something else need not apply. It is simply an engaging tribute to the golden age of Hollywood through the screen of 1940's Northern Australia, a land and time of much mythology. It's not challenging. It's not dark. It's not historically accurate. It's characters are not well developed. But it doesn't need to be it be, nor is it trying to be. It's light entertainment and a visual feast. Just switch your brain off and go for the ride!<br/> </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">12/12/2008 7:08 PM</em><em>Name</em>: Peter<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars1.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: I don't understand this movie at all.It's madness. Let's make a big,dumb hollywood film about Australia; put 'our nick' in it - at her botoxed best - get hunky Hugh (because we can't get Rusty) and a cute kid just to be sure.<br/>with its commercial type prettiness, It even manages to infuriate further(if that's possible).

Jackman gives every bit as powerful a performance, within the confines of the hero, as Gable did. Leigh's sad, real-life demons gave greater depth to Scarlet, but Kidman is perfectly fine here.

There is a distinct lack of chemistry between Kidman and Jackman which makes their romantic scenes high in the cringe stakes. The film is desperately overstylised, overwhelming the dull characters, emphasising the feeble plot and woeful screenplay. Computer enhancement is an insult to the raw beauty of the Kimberleys and those digital roos are hideously comical.

Yes, there are cliches, but the Director makes it clear that he realises that, and so is part of the whole film to accept them and just to enjoy the experience.<br/><br/>The point of the film is to entertain, and at the same time expose the corruption and life devoid of morality that Australia is built on.

Perhaps, though, it says something about the maturity of Australian cinema that we finally have our own "Magical Negros" being peddled to the rest of the world on such a grand and token scale. Even Hugh Jackman's naked chest couldn't save us from the disgustingly insulting stereotypes and schizophrenic style that went from oddball comedy to American Western and back to War Film in the space of a few hours. <br/><br/>Baz Luhrman should be disowned for making such a film.  </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">29/11/2008 9:33 PM</em><em>Name</em>: Anne<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars6.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: After all the hype, I was hoping for something more. Beautifully filmed, great supporting cast (loved Jack, Ben; David a great villain!), but still a bit disappointing. I like Baz's films, but the stylised first part jarred in this film, needed something more realistic. Jumped too quickly in second part, 3 yr gap didn't fit comfortably. Brandon stunning, Hugh very good, Nicole OK but seems to play the same stereotypical haughty character in several films. Didn't feel a real connection with 2 main characters. Clearly made for overseas audience.

I think the cartoonish, slapstick opening 20 minutes of Australia threatens alot of people's expectations and hence, they are uneasy with everything that follows. But I welcomed Baz's challenge and was taken by the spectrum of emotions in the journey that followed. Kidman carries a load of several shifts in tone and handles it wonderfully. Jackman ticks the masculine, romantic lead box and Brandon Walters (and his eyes!) are very good. The film is an intentionally melodramatic affair, the photography is artificial at times but never without intent. Congratulations, Baz...

It isn't a philosophical or historical statement. Nicole is excellent - comedic, dramatic, heartbreaking. She captured the perfect character arc. Criticism of her says she lacks warmth. I disagree. She is not the most naturalistic actors but look into those piercing blue eyes and you see Lady Sarah Ashley's heart. Hugh and Brandon and the supporting cast gave exceptional performances.

It is an American romantic epic, with predictable and mostly two dimensional characters, that just happens to be set in the Australian outback. It will be difficult for Australians to embrace this film as it is really marketed for Americans. Authenic Australian themes such as aboriginal spirituality or the stolen generation are really used for dramatic effect and plot advancement rather than exploration or celebration. "Just another romance down under" as a title would have been more appropriate.

The cinematography was amazing and the little boy Brandon Walters was the most beautiful natural actor I have seen in a long time, every scene with him was a pleasure to watch. The massive hype in the lead up to this film (media created) has done some damage, but it is a very enjoyable almost three hours and Baz does not disappoint with his usual quirkiness </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">28/11/2008 9:17 AM</em><em>Name</em>: mandy<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars8.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: I had huge expectations and enjoyed every moment of it all and was disappointed when it all ended...I felt very proud of our country and our actors.

It took us on an amazing journey into a land not many have seen.  I spent my childhood on a remote cattle station in Cape York until I was about Nullah's age and those scenes, especially mustering and how the outback comes to life in the wet, brought it all back to me. Congratulations to the brilliant cast, hardworking crew, especially Mandy Walker for her beautiful pictures and to Baz for putting Australia on the map! </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">28/11/2008 2:13 AM</em><em>Name</em>: watching<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars6.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: It certainly has it's moments but the overwelming cheese and predictable plot does threaten to take the attention away from the beautiful cinematography and melodramatic score. There's been many a critic (especially on other critics!) but I say judge for yourself.

The lightning storm behind the big screen in the distance was awesome. Most of us enjoyed it quite a bit, without been blown away. The little fella was just great. They did a great job to find him. The puppy dog was OK too, but our kimberley cross heeler-dingo would have made the film a true classic. Maybe next time Baz (la chienne comprende francaise aussie Baz).  I'm also concerned about several secret barra fishing spots being used. No-one seems to keep secrets anymore.  </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">28/11/2008 12:57 AM</em><em>Name</em>: Michael<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars8.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Pretty much agree with Marg and Dave. The film does seem compromised at times..perhaps due to the tourism tie-in. It feels incomplete, the structure is messy as is some of the editing. Despite this it is fabulously entertaining ..colourful, beautiful and has a dream like quality. All Nicole Kidman haters will probably hate her in this part, but I thought she was fantastic and loved watching her (might I add, I was once a hater but am converted). A memorable and great cinema experience. </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">28/11/2008 12:34 AM</em><em>Name</em>: Correz Pond<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars5.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: "Orstralia! Orstralia! Land of the Waratah &amp; Dahlia!" This particular cliche didn't make it into the movie but it may have well have. Baz seems to have pulled out all stops on the double-barrel cliche bazookas in the hope that if enough cinematic chestnuts are sprayed for long enough (and 165 minutes is a long time!) that some will hit their mark. Furthermore he seems to have convinced himself that skills honed flogging Chanel #5 by drenching Kidman in the stuff, could also be put to good use selling an entire continent.

If you are willing to embrace the mysticism of Aboriginal culture as portrayed then it is easy to be swept up. I agree with Margaret and David that making the film longer could have fleshed it out a bit more but it still had an emotional heart, even if there were a few forced cliches. It's the most enjoyable film I have seen in some time and I highly recomend it.

And maybe.... just perhaps... David and Margaret missed the point just a little.

I don't understand what all the negative fuss is about.  It is tongue in cheek, typically Australian humour and obviously taking the piss out of ourselves.

The cinema was half full and the audience clapped at the end which is something I have never encountered in a Sydney cinema. And they weren't in a hurry to leave a the end of the credits.<br/>I loved the way the Wizard of Oz theme is wound through the film. <br/>It's clearly been made for overseas audiences and perhaps Australian  things didn't need explaining quite so much for  overseas audiences to understand... but maybe we just feel that because we're Australians. <br/>I will definitely see it again. </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">27/11/2008 7:03 PM</em><em>Name</em>: 80sOgre<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars5.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: i give 2 and Half stars for the beautiful look of the film. the story was not clean and trimmed of loose ends as with baz's other films which was a bad thing. it did seemed like it had been rushed through in development of the script abit. more character backstory required and alittle less sub plots.  sorry Baz, I was really looking forward to something special but it is not i'm afraid. </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">27/11/2008 6:48 PM</em><em>Name</em>: indy<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars8.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: loved it, simply breath taking the way it has been filmed </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">27/11/2008 6:08 PM</em><em>Name</em>: Len Richardson<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars0.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Last week I saw "Burn after Reading" - a masterpiece.<br/>This week I saw 'Australia' - at the end, watching the interminable credits, I tried to think of something I liked about the film; I could think of nothing. <br/>David &amp; Margaret, for the best of reasons, are often too kind to Australian films.

For me this film lacks grandure.  As usual Nicole is far too conscious of the camera  and  Brandon Walters's acting is wooden when given 'close' direction, but when he's given free reign he shines.  Hugh's marvellous and looks natural.  David Wenham is unsettling good as the villian and Jack T superb, his death scene deserves an award.  All the non white actors were fantastic.  Too many close-ups for my liking, it's supposed to be about  AUSTRALIA!!. Overall - too Mills &amp; Boon. </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">27/11/2008 4:30 PM</em><em>Name</em>: Suze<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Saw Australia today - my Mum made me go with her!

I thought Kidman was dreadful. I have never come so close to walking out of a film as I did in the first 10 mins. It did not resonate with me as a truly Australian film and as clearly aimed at an international audience whicn was hard to accept.The superficial, shallow attempt at dealing with serious issues was astonighing as was the theatrical style. Flashes of Moulin Rouge came to me which I found ludicrous in the dramatic sweeping and perilous Australian Outback.

With a millions of dollars and a country where its impossible to point a camera without capturing beauty, we end up with this. <br/><br/>The script, the plot, the 3 year jump in time, the clonker lines ("drove them home drover...drove them home) - are insulting to the senses.<br/><br/>on the plus - Hugh keeps his head above water, Brandon shines, and Nicole I've already forgotten (which is a compliment for her recent work)<br/><br/>oh and dont get me started on Elton John's final number about 'drovers'.

I agree with David that it took about 20mins before the film took off but after that it was great going. Nicole was very good and worked really well with Hugh, who was at his best.

Surprised by, and welcomed, its slant. The stampede scene was extremely masterful. However, the other major scenes, later in the story, seemed very abridged/truncated. Hopefully a special edition will restore their suspense. The main problem was having 3 leads, giving the movie 3 points of view. Gone with the Wind had 1 protagonist with one very strong point of view, whose personality propelled the drama. So, more weight needed to be given to Nullah, which was done before, during and after the stampede. David Gulpilil was totally mesmerizing!!!  ALL of the indigenous actors were brilliant!!   </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">27/11/2008 1:17 AM</em><em>Name</em>: susie<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars8.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Great movie, first half hour I thought  "If I view this as a comedy I'm going to enjoy it " but after that it actually settled down and got better. Sure the corny pieces were there but I think they were there on purpose. And Hugh Jackman looks great anywhere you look at him. Went to the opening at the new Palace Centro in Brisbane - great venue, great night. One of those theatres where the seats are set out so well that you don't have to worry if a 6' hunk sits in front of you.  </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">27/11/2008 12:29 AM</em><em>Name</em>: Jonathan<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: I have just seen Australia today (its opening) - and I thought it was beautiful - It looked stunning (with often sigle frames being works of art in themselves) - and I was on the verge of tears about four times (okay, I was crying a bit). Luhrmann and the team, have created a really unique voice within this film; &amp; (again) I just loved the way it looked - and what the story evoked. To me it 'reads' more like an artpiece, than a traditional film - and the meaning that I got from it is worth 5 stars. </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">27/11/2008 12:11 AM</em><em>Name</em>: Jac<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars9.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: This was visually stunning and although everyone has talked about how long the movie is, I didn't really want to stop watching.

The performances were on the whole exceptional, scenery breathtaking at times and overall it was captivating in more ways than one. <br/>Can't quite understand all the criticism...this is an epic film largely centralised around three individuals whose lives intertwine with each other. It does have a touch of 'Pearl Harbour" about it yes but if you are going to incorporate the second world war in part of your movie it would be superficial to think that it wouldn't. It is a definite crowd pleaser and not pretentious in its make up at all.  </div><div class="AUSTRALIA"><em class="dd">26/11/2008 10:38 PM</em><em>Name</em>: tom harvey<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123406im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: I have never seen a more magnificant film in my life, Nicole Kidman was, as usual suburb ad Jackman perfected his craft in a way I never thought possible after his turn in the 'X Men' series.
