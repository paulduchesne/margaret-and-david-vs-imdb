<h2>The Hunger Games</h2>
<p class="ratd"> Rated <em>M</em></p>
<p><em>Review by David Stratton</em></p>
<p>THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL opens nationally tomorrow. And now to THE HUNGER GAMES. Sometime in the future in what was once North America, the rulers of a decadent dictatorship force 24 teenagers, 12 boys and 12 girls, from each of the country's 12 enslaved districts, to fight to the death in a protracted contest relayed to the entire country on television. In District 12, 16-year-old Katniss, JENNIFER LAWRENCE, volunteers when her young sister is originally chosen, and, together with Peeta, JOSH HUTCHERSON, son of the baker, becomes a 'Tribute', taken to the nation's capital to be groomed and trained for the Hunger Games.<br/><br/>Hard on the heels of JOHN CARTER comes another woeful Hollywood big budget picture and poses the question - have they forgotten how to make good large-scale action films</p>
<h2>Further comments</h2>
<p>MARGARET: I think, apparently, they were in the location where they were shooting and they needed to keep them away from the stars. I pretty much agree with you but I think there's been a problem in the translation from the book to the film, because apparently - and I haven't read the book, which is really for young teens I think - it's been written in the first person from Katniss' point of view and I think that translation to the third person perspective on her, a lot has been lost in the translation, which is a shame because there is the potential there for this intrepid young woman and Jennifer Lawrence has an amazing screen presence. I think she is wonderful.<br/><br/>DAVID: Yes. Yes, she is very good. Yes.<br/><br/>MARGARET: I think the other great thing is Lenny Kravitz, to tell you the truth. I think he really comes alive in this film. <br/><br/>DAVID: One of the problems, I think, is that given that the books were aimed at young women, I think the filmmakers have been terrified at making anything too violent, because I thought it is a very nasty story. Young people - having teenagers as young as 12 having to kill each other. Fighting to the death.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Yes. Yes. Yep.<br/><br/>DAVID: So it's a really horrible story but they've had to make a film that will appeal and will be censored, classified, for young people and I think that's a compromise they've never managed to come up with.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Yes. I noticed Steven Soderbergh shot second unit on it. <br/><br/>DAVID: I didn't notice that.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Yes, he did. I'm giving it two stars.<br/><br/>DAVID: I'm giving it one and a half.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[0]]<br>The shaky camerawork made me feel sick and I only watched it for 15 minutes. When will this trend end? David is absolutely right on his criticism of this type of camerawork - bring back the long still shot.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[9]]<br>i have read the book and got so addicted to them, you wouldn't know. when I watched the movie I knew that if I didn't read the book I definitely would get lost through out it. but, I can't believe that magaret and david gave a score lower than 3 stars. i find it amazing about the rules under the capitol and how you can't run away, and some of the punishments...i always think about how smart that was explained in the movie. some of the parts were different to the book, but as a movie it's better that way.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br>I loved the books and would have loved the movie except for a few things. The pros are that we got a little more info on mutts and such, but the mutts at the end looked like more dogs then wolves. Not to mention there were only three of them. I think the movie stuck to most of the plot. They didn't make district 4's tributes careers and they made the nettle med. for Peeta a spreading medicine instead.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[9]]<br>I watched this review months ago and subsequently chose not to see it at the time. My taste seems to always fall in line with the reviewers (usually David) however this has been the first time that I've actually disagreed with a score. I agree that the shaky camera work was nauseating at first, but I would argue that the shots throughout the latter part of the film were effective at ensuring that the viewer only perceived what the protagonist perceived, which added to the tension. I agree that the storyline was a little predictable, but good nonetheless.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[10]]<br>I absolutely loved this movie and I am a huge fan of the books. I think had Margret and David read the books, provided they understood them and their importance they would be embarrassed. The movie couldn't be an action thriller glorifying the deaths because then the movie would be just as bad as the Capitol. Anyone who has read the books should understand that. I wonder what they'll think of Catching Fire because while I loved this movie Catching Fire is miles above it and is a lot more action packed. Shall be interesting.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[4]]<br>I was extremely disappointed with this movie and the translation between the book and the movie was extremely disappointing. The storyline was completely muddled up and some of the people who survived longer in the book died instantly in the bloodbath.

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[9]]<br>I think that it was a brilliant movie because most movies involve what a male or a female should do to be a leader and behave however in this movie it shows leadership with both parts male and female. katniss defending the people she loves and protecting them and peters maturating in not killing anyone on purpose regardless on the situation, and together katniss and peter are able to stand up to president snow (a bully) and defend there rights .although this message may not be fully clear, this movie is showing teens the better way to act <br/></br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[3]]<br>People giving this 5 stars and insulting Margaret and David for giving it such a low rating need to grow up. <br><br>As a fan of the book series, I was severely disappointed by the film. Simply put, I was bored to death. I agree that the conundrum of working with an extremely ugly plot of children killing each other, yet trying to market the film to teens would have made it very difficult, but I believe they could have done much better than they did.</br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[10]]<br>Well there you have it. Now we know Australia is going down the drain when even the most sophisticated and intellectual people on Oz television like David and Margaret can be convinced to make a bad review about a movie with such a clear and incredibly important social commentary about the increasing malaise affecting Western society. Oz has been bought off by big corporations and is a supermarket for vital minerals which is why the country culturally is going down the gurgler. The Hunger Games is extremely important well cited social commentary pay no attention to this review!</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[10]]<br>David and Margaret rated this film in correctly. i saw this film three days after and i thought it was splendid. The action isn't as good as the action in lord of the rings but it was still good. Ever since my friends and i saw the film, we started playing our version at our local park, we have 12 kids from stage 1 and 12 from stage 2, but stage 1 forms an alliance and so does stage 2. thats how much each side enjoyed the film.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[10]]<br>I first say this film the day after the very poor rating by Dave and Margaret: but had promised to take my teenage daughter.<br><br>After the film my daughter asked what I thought; which was 'the most interesting piece of cinema I had seen in 10 years'. We subsequently own DVD, and have critically looked at shooting style ect; I think David missed the point, and the style perfectly conveys the choatic feel of the combative environment the tributes are in.

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br>It seems to me like you payed more attention to the credits than the actual movie. Although not being a big fan of the books, I really liked the movie. Jennifer Lawrence was fantastic as Katniss and i could empathise more with her in the movie than in the book thanks to her emotional performance. I admit that the shaky camera work was a little sloppy but it created tension throughout the movie that had me personally on the edge of my seat. After watching your review I put off watching the movie but I actually really enjoyed it.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[0]]<br>I'm horrified that such a movie is allowed to be made and released. So young attractive people making love is taboo, but watching underage teenage boys kill 12 year old innocent girls is ok? This world really is heading in the direction that the film portrayed. A decadent hole! How appaulling it is to see that the slaughtering of innocent young children, is considered entertainment. This was just too much and it's not about action movies not being my thing and to turn away if I don't like it. It's the fact that others are seeing it.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[0]]<br>I couldn't read the book becuase it was so badly written and I've just attempted to watch the film but the constant shaky hand-held camera made it impossible for me to watch. Pathetic. For those looking for a movie where children are forced to kill each other, I suggest you watch Battle Royale - it's awesome.<br/></br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[7]]<br>Personally I think that the Hunger Games film and novels are both aimed for a specific audience and only really appeal to that audience. I found that the transition from novel to film was quite good, yes it has been censored and bits have been cut out, though if they didn't it would have made it longer than it needed to be and for the fact that it has been censored if it hadn't not many people would want to watch it. As usual the novel was better than the film though the film was good in it's own rights.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[6]]<br>I actually enjoyed this movie, it was better than i thought it was going to be. I thought it was going to be very corny and stupid, it was still a bit corny but actually had an ok story line andthe book made a very good illustration which was portrayed well in the movie. Throughout the movie, the fight scenes had very wavy and crazy, hard to follow camera movements which out me off and was hard to see who was fighting who. But overall it was a pretty good movie and worth seeing.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[6]]<br>I disagree with the point made by David that the action scenes weren't filmed well. From the perspective of someone who has read the novels, I felt as though the cinematography was used appropriately to convey action sequences. The chopping, fast pace of it gave the film suspense and tension and made you feel like you were in the area along with Katniss. <br><br>I do agree with the point Margaret raised about how the transition from the novel's first person point of view to the big screens third person though. A lot of emotion from the novel was unfortunately lost.</br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[9]]<br>Observing from someone who has read all the series of the novels and seen the film, disagree to Margaret and David and gave this film 4 and a half stars. I agree in some parts of this film, the camera movement was unsteady therefore hard to concentrate and focus, confused me as an audience on the current circumstances that they were filming. Overall, I think the film would've been better if the film was to explore further into detail such as narrating where in the world they were.<br>Overall, this film was a pleasure to view and is highly recommended.</br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[7]]<br>I would have to disagree with some of the points said by Margaret and David, as a movie that had great sources (for this, which is the novel), would not entirely have a negative review, you should've considered about some aspects such as story line, but movie items are totally fine. For the movie however, it is a great movie with a good storyline, but, as stated by Margaret and David, was lacking in quality, the action scenes, the censorship, some of which I would have to agree on. Overall, it is an awesome movie for book and movie people.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[6]]<br>Too be honest their review is quite interesting the camera shots during the games were terrible and their editing was also not soo good. I think with better preparation and re-thinking the fight scenes and how they should be shot would assist in the making and maybe even make it a 4 or 5 star film but their were just small aspects of the film that had let it down. Definatley in the making of the second one they need to be more interesting and create suspense within there scenes. For that i give it 3 stars</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[9]]<br>I haven't read the books, but you don't have to be a genius to see that this movie explores a lot more than a bunch of kids killing each other. The political and social messages were powerful but not in your face (resistance against oppression is possible; pitting people against each other is a successful method of oppression but all you need is a little hope; life is a performance, etc). Also, the appearance of an awesome, strong but humane female lead was inspirational. And how about the amazing costumes and makeup? Gold eyeliner on Lenny Kravitz? Yes please!<br/></br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[3]]<br>I am a very big fan of the trilogy and this movie was quite a dissapointment to me. I didn't like the camera-work; to me it was extremely dodgy. I didn't like the audio; there was inappropriate music in nearly all of the action scenes, and the long silences that are then ended by a scream or foliage russling was very annoying. I think the movie would have been much better had it been told from Katniss' point of view. Then there could have been attention paid to the right chaaracters.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>I didn't read the books (thank God, I get enough of knowing what's coming with Game of Thrones) so I watched this with fresh eyes. I enjoyed it. Not overly sentimental, moved at a decent speed, and the main actress is good as the reluctant hero. Though the sets are great, you don't pay much attention to them. (Strangely, the 'plainest' set is the most effective - the picking of the names ceremony within what looks like a prison courtyard.) Nor did I pay more than passing attention to themes mentioned below - just a good story.</p>

You know, this movie is not actually just about killing, violence, gore, etc. It actually has many strong themes, such as weighing humanity against your life, courage, bravery, determination, perseverance. I am looking forward to the Mockingjay movie, third movie to this one, when I know that it will not be violent, like the book Mockingjay. So...I give this movie 5 stars.</p>

It is definitely not only for girls. Just because there is a love triangle, the fighting pushes away most of it, the love story is just a side story. But I definitely recommend it as well.

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[4]]<br/>As a fan of sci-fi, this is a terrible example of the genre. Perhaps there is more depth in the books, but the movie on its own is appallingly shallow, both in storytelling and the characters themselves.<br/><br/>Are we really being asked to believe this could happen? We don't even like kids being used to make our iPhones or pick cocoa. So how is this a "possible future"? The whole premise is childishly absurd.<br/><br/>One good sci-fi movie about kids used as fighters is "Sky Crawlers". Ironically, this anime makes Hunger Games look like a cartoon.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>I'm completely disappointed by this review and ratings. Yes, it's not a perfect film, but it sure is compelling. I was struck by the political message (albeit watered down somewhat), the strong heroine (unlike any I've seen portrayed by Hollywood), the necessary yet not-glorified violence, the action and the romance. The movie stayed in my mind long after it finished.<br/>You give Twilight 4 stars and this 2? Katniss, strong and intelligent, is far superior to a weak and obsessive Bella. Next time, you should maybe get a young adults opinion because here you've clearly both missed the point.</p>

Perhaps they could have dealt with the suspense a little better, but i appreciated the violence wasn't too gratuitous.  It would have taken away from the idea of power, choice and survival without all cost.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>I think the film was great, the start and the middle especially, the ending could have been better as there was quite a lot of going back and forth. I enjoyed it as did my parents...wish it was a little more violent however. Good film.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[6]]<br/>To all those saying it could be more violent, did we see a different film?  I'm not quite sure what rating would be appropriate but I found it sucked you in and made you feel little better as a viewer, than those who constructed the idea of the 'Hunger Games' in the first place.  <br/><br/>I did feel perhaps too old for the film as rather than cheer on the young protagonists, all I could focus on was the tragedy of young lives wasted.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[7]]<br/>Firstly, I agree with M&amp;D's review, just not their scores. The editing was extremely sloppy, the camerawork too shaky (though it didn't bother me) and easily 30 mins too long. And they're spot-on about the compromised violence.<br/><br/>But the performances were great (Jennifer is a star), with the exception of some of the Games cannon fodder. And the action scenes were poor, way too weak.<br/><br/>Those commenting on having to read the books? Sorry, the books are irrevelevant - if you can't tell a standalone movie, you've failed the task. Good movie, but not that great.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>its a shame M and D didn't like this film, i thought the use of minimal violence really worked it gave a more real and first person account of the games. as for translation from the book i found that this was the first film adaptation that was actually better than the book and third person gave far more information and context to what was happening with in the games. personally this was the best blockbuster i've seen in a long time</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[1]]<br/>So, where was the hunger? I read the novel and from the train ride through to the start of the games, Katniss gains weight. JL was a little too voluptuous at the start. None of the characters were really likable so there was no reason to actually become involved in the film oneself and why couldn't more fight scenes be shown from 50 - 100 feet away instead form the nostril perspective. Since the earliest period of film making, violence has been dealt with creatively without showing actual deed, why not here? Worse than John Carter, and that stunk!</p>

The action scenes were absolutely fantastic, and they keep you in suspense. I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie. Do you really know what teenagers these days like watching?!!! Maybe your producers should consider using someone younger to rate the kid's and teen's movies. By the way I'm 12. Best movie ever.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[2]]<br/>I saw this film primarily because it starred Jennifer Lawrence, who gave such a stellar performance in Winter's Bone.  I dove in head first not knowing about the theme, which shocked me.  Children forced to violently kill each other??  Sure-fire, cheap  horror device.   I would rather have watched Seven, The Shining or Silence of the Lambs.  I like my gore presented with some suspense, intelligent scripting and credible acting.   I suppose  Lawrence is now contractually stuck to star in the next  1/2 a dozen in the franchise.  Shame.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[2]]<br/>One star for Lenny Kravitz. The rest is a steaming pile of ordure that betrays the origins of the book. Long, ponderous, overdone turkey which will please the popcorn set and distress serious filmgoers. The worst element is the use of vomit cam to film most of this travesty. Impossible to see who is fighting whom (a compromise to the censors) and implausibility follows implausibility which lacks the detail present in the book. Find out what else is showing and go there.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[2]]<br/>The books obviously gave a lot more exposition, setting time &amp; place for the audience. The film does none of this - production design is over the top and the fight scenes are the worst I have ever seen - poorly choreographed and shot in nausea cam (so as not to offend the censors) this is a huge yawn. Interminable tracking shots and banal dialogue, lots of film "references" and a distinct lack of tension. In one scene, where the hero is disguised as a rock, I laughed out loud. Overlong, pretentious dud.</p>

And some of the junk they rate at 4 and 5...<br/><br/>The lead actress is good, the script OK but the fight scenes are poorly edited. Its big problem is the 'unbelievability' of the background scenario . I was lost when  wild animals were conjured from nowhere. Was the whole thing an hallucination?<br/><br/>1984 meets  Truman Show? Maybe, but although it addressed some big issues its target  audience seemed to be tweens.<br/></p>

The acting was great! And i agree with the camera moving around and it was hard to focus on what was happening. It was thought provoking as i cried when Rue died and Prim was screaming for Katniss because I have a little sister. I hope Catching Fire is better!</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[7]]<br/>I am very disappointed about M&amp;D comments. It seems they disregarded the movie without even bothering to do any research about the books and with misplaced contempt.<br/>It didn't matter in the initial bloodshed that the others were unknown - the aim was survival and nothing else. Margaret, the books are not aimed at young teenage girls. It has a powerful humanity message. I am 38 years old and read the trilogy in one week. The Capitol could be compared to Hollywood. <br/>Your review let me down because you totally missed the point. I expect better from you, guys :-(</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>I thought the movie was wonderful and i feel like they captured it really well from the books. I have to agree with Margret and David on Liam Hemsworth barely having a role although in the book he had just as much time. I love Jennifer Lawrence, she really made the movie for me. I have to disagree though with the action scenes being hard to follow, I easily followed them and could tell the sex of the character. To be quite frank, I think Margret is being very petty.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[6]]<br/>What should have been a much-talked about film, was really made on an obviously low budget. Not very futuristic-looking at all. Thius was the most disappointing part for me. It was well cast, even though I questioned Lenny Kravitz in the role as Cinna. The shaky camera-work was obviously to dismiss some of the gore, as the audience I watched it with were mainly 12 year old boys, at a guess (no kidding). The books were excellent, but the movie lacked the tension, and dimension, of the novels. I liked it, it just didn't do the novel "justice".</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[6]]<br/>After hearing M&amp;D's unpromising review, along with the other rave reviews the film has received, I erased all expectation before I saw this film. I found a few things about this film a bit irritating - the excessive use of a handheld camera was annoying and pointless, the context of the film needed a much more justified introduction than the few small texts at the beginning and the lead characters were totally un-relatable. Don't get me wrong, the cast does well, I just felt a bit disconnected from them. Aside, the costumes and CGI were first class and entertaining.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>How David and Margaret could so woefully miss the point is beyond me.  Annoying shaky-cam ultimately detracts little from this modern political and social commentary. Imagine 1984 meets The Truman Show, exploring class inequality, totalitarian government and society's insatiable consumption of reality entertainment. Seemingly a sadistic exploration of human depravity, it resolves into an unpredictable, gripping drama of resilience, sacrifice, loss and the expediency of love. Jennifer Lawrence as our defiant heroine sets the scene for a future confrontation between a fat, tyrannical political class and the simmering masses.  She is one cute rebel you don't want to miss!</p>

I was dreading it as I thought it would be very much like your review.  HOWEVER I really enjoyed it.  It portrayed the book very well, it wasn't 'clawing'  It wasn't gorey for gorey sake. Donald Sutherland and the other major stars were excellently cast.  I normally agree with Margaret (more so than David) about movies, but this one I think you have gotten it wrong.

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[9]]<br/>For this film in particular, I don't think people (Margaret and David) should be critically harsh without having read the book.  David, many of the supporting characters don't make an impression in the book - why would they here?  Margaret, you should evaluate the film based on its content, not because Soderbergh was involved.  The story is controversial and doesn't translate easily to a PG-13 (US) or M (AU) rating.  That said, this film is full of thought-provocation, really nice camera work and great makeup and costuming.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[10]]<br/>It had constant suspense, the actors knew exactly how to portray their character and the costumes and sets were amazing. <br/><br/>I have read the book and compared with other movies based on books, it followed the story line pretty well. They cut down the violence and gore to a minimal level, so people won't be leaving the cinema feeling disgusted.<br/><br/> The only put back is that they cut out some important characters (e.g. Madge) and events (e.g. Peeta losing his leg).<br/><br/>Next time you do a review for a movie aimed at teens, why don't you get their opinion first?</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[9]]<br/>I have to say, if either David or Margaret had read the the first book of the trilogy, you'd see that it was from the protagonist's point of view, so the who was killed when was totally unknown to her. The opening combat at the cornucopia was supposed convey one thing, it was a bloodbath. It wasn't important who died, because those that didn't survive to cross Katniss's path were completely inconsequential to the story. It's lucky I rarely take a film critics word. They so often forget what films are about. Entertainment.</p>

Like some other comments in this thread I can't believe the disparity between M + D's review of Twilight and Hunger Games. This is a VASTLY superior movie. Dont let M+Ds review put you off seeing this movie. I had zero expectations going in and was very impressed. David - the opening "battle" is supposed to convey sensless, cold hearted slaughter. Does it really matter who fought/killed who? Or of which gender? Pedantic.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[7]]<br/>I hadn't read the books so I didn't know what to expect. Some of the reviews were quite positive so I braved it with my partner. Both over 50 and with no children in tow we felt a bit strange. We enjoyed it more than we thought we would. I saw parallels with Survivor and also Regency Great Britain - when people also paraded their extreme wealth infront of people living in terrible poverty. We were distracted though by the number of young teens in the cinema who were unsupervised and ran up &amp; down aisles. Too young and bored!</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[7]]<br/>This was a faithful adaptation of the book - perhaps a little too faithful, as I found some of the most enjoyable scenes to be new additions, such as Seneca Crane's fate and the District 11 riot.<br/><br/>The shaky-cam bothered for the first few minutes but my eyes adjusted shortly after.<br/><br/>The book is openly critical of the USA/Capitalism but the film waters this down in aiming for a broader appeal.<br/><br/>The cast all give their very best, especially Jennifer Lawrence, and the film is long but held my attention well.</p>

Well written, riveting and powerful I expected the movie to mirror the book. However, I was very disappointed with a lot of aspects of the film and overall I did not like or enjoy it. <br/><br/>When a book is so magnificent it is hard to reflect and live up to it in a film.<br/><br/>The movie was a let down and I am disappointed that I saw it as it nearly ruined the books for me.</p>

Sure the ending lacked punch, and the shaky cam fight scenes were annoying, but perhaps that was to obscure the violence the keep the rating down.<br/>The social commentary on the separation of wealth in society and the pervasion of reality tv, and where it may head if unchecked provided a lot of substance I was not expecting. <br/>All in all enjoyable. .</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>Interesting! Was really surprised when I came to check what you both had thought of this one, and saw the low scores. I think this is one of those movies that can split audiences opinions (always fun though).<br/><br/>I thought they handled the censoring fine, you don't need to see gore to feel the violence. I haven't read the books but at least for the switch to film I loved how they managed to make some light moments to save drama exhaustion.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it's a film about kids murdering each other in bloodsport, still a better story than twilight ;)</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>Pleasantly surprised to have enjoyed this film after reading M and D's review. I have read the first novel (currently on the second) and the adaptation was quite faithful. Jennifer Lawrence is superb as Katniss and carried the film on her shoulders. The camera work wasn't all over the place all the time so I didn't have any major issues with it. It could have been more violent considering the content of the story - it's no Battle Royale and some parts do drag but this has potential to be a good trilogy</p>

But to be honest it can only be watched once, not over again for the excitement and surprises won't work on a second viewing, plus the costumes were a bit weird. <br/><br/>She's a skilled hunter, who's life goes into Jeopardy, which was just enough to get me involved and enjoy the film. Personally I thought the film on an emotional level was much more involving than John Carter.</p>

I am normally not a fan of hand held film work, but appreciated its effectiveness in minimising the potential  graphic violence of the actions scenes. As for criticisms about lack of originality ( Battle Royale etc) Theirs not much original about most movies... or music these days!

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>This film is a tragedy set in a futuristic dystopia. Its provocative, intense themes are well worth parents discussing and exploring with their adolescent children and the narrative is clear and effective, despite David Stratton's hissy fits about the camerawork. Most importantly, the film is well cast, and the film script stays true to the books. 'A nasty story' indeed. So is Lord of the Flies, but that doesnt make it any less relevant for young people.<br/>What astonished me the most, David and Margaret, was looking back at your review for Twilight. FOUR STARS, you said. you're kidding.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[2]]<br/>Such a dispassionate, vacant excuse for a film. I can't understand the appeal at all; though perhaps I just can't engage pop-culture anymore. <br/><br/>Ultimately it came across as a bizarre, malformed convergence between the likes of "Hostel" and "The Librarian: Quest for the Spear." Not interested in the slightest. Ended up listening to music for the duration.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[4]]<br/>It's a decent watch but definitely nothing amazing at least not to the point it has been hyped up. For a story with such a dark premise they should have/could have made a more adult film to reflect the content  and not try to make it suitable for kids by having ridiculously shaky blurred actions scenes and also pointlessly shaky opening shots (I'm sure to create a feeling of insecurity etc.....but unnecessary).   Even with less graphic images for kids, the premise of the movie alone should deter most parents allowing the younger of teens/pre-teens to see it.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>The Hunger Games enters the world of cinema bringing something new and exciting to the table. A rather nasty story about teenagers forced to kill one another in order to survive purely for the entertainment of a select group. There is plenty of vividly creative production design to be acknowledged, characters to build a warm connection to and a sense of urgency via the camerawork brought to the screen that adds to the suspense constructed throughout. To top it off, there is a wonderful performance from the ever impressive Jennifer Lawrence and does not feel its 142 minute length!</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[7]]<br/>I thought it was a very good movie, however, having read the books some detail was missing. Katniss is meant to be a lot more outspoken and feisty but they portrayed her a little similar to bella from Twilight. Peeta and Katniss' love story did not go as deep as it was supposed to go and finally the wolves at the end were meant to be mutated forms of the other Tributes. They were meant to have their eyes and hair and a collar that had their district number on it. Frankly, well shot but a little disappointed.</p>

And apparently the books are a lot more intense than the movie!<br/><br/>I was thoroughly entertained, it was my friday night popcorn fest and suited the occaison perfectedly.  I have recommended it to a couple of friends already.<br/><br/>Yes its a horrifying idea(teens having to kill each other to survive) as part of a gladiator type game.  But really why can't Jennifer Lawrence be as empowering as say Russell Crowe.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>I was a big fan of the books and I think they did a great job of translating it to screen. There isn't much in the way of character developement in the other contestants in the book either as it is written in first person from Katniss' perspective. I thought the performance by Jennifer Lawrence was very well done and the actors in the supporting roles added vibrance to the film. I though it had much more substance and far less "tweeny" than Twillight.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[6]]<br/>I agree with David on this, the handheld camera was overused in this film I think. I appreciate it might have been used to produce a grittier environment but some of those introductory scenes really didn't need that. Jumping between random shots of faces and irrelevant things also seemed pointless.<br/><br/>Some of the action scenes were also pretty poorly shot. A lot of the time, it was just cameras swerving around with blurry objects moving everywhere. It was hard to tell what was happening, and I think there are better ways to convey a sense of chaos or a fight.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[6]]<br/>I saw this after I saw The Raid, so fighting-wise it was a (huge) step down. I'm going to read the books now, because I trust they are better than the movie. I give The Hunger Games 3 our of 5 stars because of the artistic displays of fire and some lessons on survival, and also for Peeta's incredible camouflage. Other than that, the movie is highly predictable, even for someone who hasn't read the books.</p>

Well done - you've watched a Japanese film about the same thing as the Hunger Games. What? Is there a law saying that stories cant be reused? <br/><br/>For mine, as a 40+ who has read the first book, I found it very entertaining and despite what M&amp;D said about it, it translated very well. The 13 yo I went with to see it is now in his room finishing the book - cant say fairer than that.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[3]]<br/>First things first, I thought Jennifer Lawrence was fantastic. Loved her performance. Unfortunately the rest is poor. So many plot holes and unanswered questions. A lot of minor details really annoyed me, including the complete lack of depth in all the other contestant characters. And the shaky for the action sequences were terrible. <br/>I actually enjoyed the first half of the film more, but the second half was poor. <br/>Ultimately I was left with a feeling of a missed opportunity. Could have been a good, compact film, but tried to cover too much story without enough depth.</p>

This however is neither. Yet another American cash-cow aimed at pleasing people with a quarter of a brain. Most frustrating is the good premise having to be made to please tweens. Even worse, a proper version of this premise has already been made. Battle Royale, this film is most certainly not.</p>

Apart from that, I thought this was a very interesting film and, if aimed at teenagers, quite a well made, well acted, thought-provoking one. Reality TV meets ancient Rome, meets Lord of the Flies. Wonderful. Katniss is gorgeous and I love that the writer chose a warrior princess for this.</p>

And were it not for that, we as audience members would be sucked into the same voyeurism and the love of violence the the film sets out to critique.

The brutality of the film is offset by ridiculous outfits and riot police who are not intimidating in the slightest.  I feel this concept should have warranted a far darker film that that was given and the concept of class differences and the oppression of people should have more heavily looked at.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[6]]<br/>Whatever critiques are made - the movie works. In the session I saw the young audience was rapt and attentive and allowing for the length, that's a miracle<br/>Media remarks about Rue's skin and Kitniss's weight are petty. The violence is a non-issue; for school I saw Lord of the Flies (1963)  and Animal Farm in 5th grade.<br/>Rollerball (1975), Robert Sheckley's Victim stories, King's Running Man all play the same game and aren't acknowledged in the media - how soon we forget.</p>

But thank goodness my brother asked me to come with him since her had no one to go with. Saying that this movie is aimed at young teens is completely untrue (I'm 25) goes to show that you really weren't interested in watching this movie to begin with. This is your worst review yet, next time I watch ATM I'll think twice about what you guys say now. <br/>Very disappointed M&amp;D!</p>

Definitely no 'Lord of the Flies' or 'Battle Royale'.  <br/><br/>Looking at all these 4-5 star user reviews, I can't believe how bias and immature many of you are.

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[4]]<br/>I think the movie would have been so much better without the hand held shooting. In the first ten minutes i was just praying "please dont all be like this. Good casting, great sets and gripping action scenes were destroyed by this what, seemed as haphazard editing and nauseating camera work. I loved the books s and can only hope that the second instalment is shot and edited to reflect the talent of the cast and a fantastic story.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>I thought this was a great film, in comparison to much of the drivel we see coming out of Hollywood these days.  Sure, the camera work was shaky (which David repeatedly states he hates) but for a movie aimed at teenagers I found this quite interesting and suspenseful.  I haven't read the books but I think the movie surely deserves better than what M&amp;D have given it here.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[7]]<br/>I found it quite enjoyable and I haven't read any of the books.  The setting was intriguing too and I was curious about the new world that was being depicted. The film was certainly making a comment on reality TV as well, and seemed to be drawing comparisons with the old days in the Roman colosseum.  Overall though, that seemed to be pretty much the single theme of the film. Katniss was a great character.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[4]]<br/>This isn't awful by any means, but it does have many deficiencies, such as a lack of  motivation by the main characters, complete lack of humour/wit, plodding story progression (it takes an hour to get to the games) shaky cam used to disguise inept fight sequences, plot holes you can drive a truck through, and unresolved plot strands (I know it's only part one, but don't leave the audience dangling).<br/><br/>The only truly good performance is that of Woody Harrelson, who brings some levity to the movie. Otherwise it's very dour.<br/><br/>See Battle Royale, which as least has something to say.</p>

Do we live in such a sick violence obsessed society to think the gruesome depiction of young people murdering each other relentlessly makes good cinema?

Promoted at all ages as a edgy, gripping, emotional box office monster... what was made is a child like, predictable, uninvolved, teenage straight to DVD disaster. Very disappointed at the lack of depth, maturity, level of intelligence required to watch, lack of character development and fight scenes even the power ranges would say are pathetic! From the money invested we should be allowed to expect more.</p>

Sorry David and Margaret, but I cant agree with any of your reviews any more.<br/><br/>You guys judged the movie on what it could have been rather than what it is.<br/><br/>In the end, it was a well made movie despite some minor edges.

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[3]]<br/>Not worth the watch. Was bored to absolute tears, Margy and Davy were spot on in their review. My lord it coulda been sometin! i believe it would of been 4/5 stars if the lead was Jim Carrey and not some nobody. <br/><br/>Put it quite simply, i woulda preffered to see goats roll down hills for 10 hours rather then watch this film. Thats sayin something!! Hopefully the sequal will atleast feature a sidekick goat.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[9]]<br/>Margaret, David - Tripe! This film leaves compelling viewer impact. Kill flick? No, it's a post modern Animal Farm. Long scenes (viewers think), steady/unsteady takes, minimalist sound; all add tension. The precis is society discarding moral and social conscience for narcissistic materialist hedonism. An extreme story - sacrificing innocents (arguably society's most precious resource) for gratification of empowered minorities. Characterisations and mis-en-scene of the capital/districts communities satirically juxtapose beautifully; critiquing reality television viewers (Peeta and Katniss learning role playing manipulating audience favour). The development of Katniss' humanity - an extraordinary proposition and performance (initially defensive, she evolves to instigate attack).</p>

David getting it wrong, however, I have almost come to expect ;)<br/>It is an incredibly good adaptation, but as with any adaptation, it was never going to be able to completely recreate the book's experience. It's funny that other people mention a lack of character development - we cannot learn what every tribute likes for dinner, not to mention the hopes and dreams of the Prep Team or the Gamemakers.  <br/><br/>I cannot wait to see the next one!</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[9]]<br/>The Hunger Games trilogy are precious in my household. These books got an 11 yr old reading where Harry Potter couldn't.  We all loved the books.  So my fingers were crossed when we went to see the film. Verdict?  A worthy version! They are not action books, and thankfully neither was the film. Does the film stand alone?  Maybe not.  But most viewers will have read the books, and will love the film. It's generally faithful, and my only concern was the casting of Cinna: Lenny was not the cool, complex, quiet Cinna of the books. I missed him.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>Well, the handycam gave me a headache at first, but I believe it settled down, &amp; conveyed the first-person POV well. This movie did what it set out to do extremely well. No classic, it won't last as well as Deliverance or Rambo, but a good yarn. Would've liked more pathos (but Cat's response to Rue's fate a high point in recent cinema), &amp; where was the hunger... A good watch all round. D &amp; M, you missed the point - &amp; you missed all the Metropolis references! Whoops.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[7]]<br/>I know this is primarily targeted at young girls but as a 25+ male I have to admit, I enjoyed the film. I understand the need for shaky camera work during fight scenes to ensure the PG rating and to not block the under 15 audience and it didn't really bother me. I think the camera work on Quantum of Solace was far worse. Given the long running length, I'm more surprised I still enjoyed it. I'm really not sure why M&amp;D disliked it so strongly.</p>

It had a clear 'start, middle, end' (with some three part films not having this), the shaky cam was only for action scenes.<br/>I also am glad that we DIDN'T get to know the 24 people. That's sort of the point. We're following this story with a heroine and seeing it from her POV. She can't know each character's background. She's seeing a bunch of scared frightened kids.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[9]]<br/>This 51 year old female totally disagrees with the so-called 'professional' reviewer's grading. How can professionals make comments like "problem in the translation from the book" (Margaret), and "it's really a horrible story" (David) when neither have read the books. The film generated huge box office numbers and rave reviews. Margaret &amp; David have lost credibility in my mind. Their review gives me the impression of having been hastily done, with prejudice, and with a dismissive and haughty air. No more "At The Movies" in my house.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>I strongly disagree with Margaret and David's review. The books are NOT aimed at young women. They are aimed at young adults- both male and female. The violence in the movie is true to the novel. Anything above an M rating would be cutting out the target audience. It doesn't need to show unnecessary blood and guts.<br/>The movie is a great adaption of the novel. I hardly noticed the shaky-cam at all. For a film with quite a small budget by Hollywood standards ($78 million) the crew of The Hunger Games did an amazing job.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[6]]<br/>I have read the trilogy, and this is what I thought of the movie:<br/>1. I really hated the shaky camera action, and the blurred vision - can't they make movies anymore to show tension/delight/anxiety without this annoying camera technique?  <br/>2. Where is the "hunger"?  During the games, we see Katniss and Rue eating well.  In the book, there was desperation for water and food.<br/>3. Whilst Kravitz gave a credible performance I still couldn't see him personify Cinna as written in the book.<br/><br/>The film lacked the depth of raw emotion and desperation depicted in the book.  <br/></p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>Never read the books, came into it having only the slightest idea of what it was about and in all honesty loved it. The camera work in the action sequences was not the best choice to go shaky, especially from such a technically conventional filmmaker as Gary Ross but the story was engaging and the performances from the actor's were brilliant (Lawrence obviously the best of the pack). <br/></p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[7]]<br/>I enjoyed this movie, especially as it led up to the start of the deadly contest. The opening scenes in District 12 are stunning, with the revolting spectacle of the drawing out of the names grabbing the viewer by the throat. Jennifer Lawrence has genuine star quality, and for the most part the strong narrative drove the story well, but it lost its way somewhere in the woods. The last third was too drawn out and the killings too emotionally detached from the viewer, sucking the raw tension out of the deadly cat and mouse games.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[9]]<br/>I had never heard of the book, or the movie, or just about every actor, but there was not much else to watch and my husband suggested this one.  We both thought it was FANTASTIC, it has kept us thinking and discussing plot and possibilities ever since. I can't wait to buy the book trilogy to find out more about it. Since our 12-year-old son was on camp and missed out, we have both offered to watch it again with him. I rarely see a movie twice.  Yes there were some inevitable weak spots, but still very engaging and thought-provoking.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>I think some critics are way to harsh on his film, i thought it was captivating suspenseful and exciting. It had me emotionally invested in the characters from the start, even had me tearing up a few times. The shaky cam did get a bit annoying but also served a purpose of making the viewer feel more apart of the action making it more suspenseful.  I do think its a shame about the PG13 rating thats not really what the target audience should be, it should be 15 plus.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[1]]<br/>Can't agree with you M&amp;D. Between you, you gave this movie an average of 1.75 stars - this is just far too generous. This movie is utterly terrible. I ound myself so bored and uninterested because you are not given any reason to relate to or feel for the characters. The choices that the characters make just don't seem plausible. The personality traits of the "tributes" aren't believable, because no back story or reasons are given for their evil nature. Why is their so much vengeance between them. I Just couldn't get emotionally involved with this movie at all.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[2]]<br/>Mediocre schlock. Typical YA fiction, trying to be edgy and not gong far enough, trying to be meaningful but only stuttering out some half-formed simplistic idea. If it had wanted to be a commentary on society and reality TV shows, there should've been more artifice to the eponymous Hunger Games and a greater portrayal of the over-consumption of the upper-crust of society. As it stands, your kids'll love it, but it is ultimately pretty bland. Watch Battle Royale or The Running Man instead.</p>

I could best describe this as a truman show, lord of the flies, slash avartar type plot. Jennifer Lawerence and Josh Hutcherson did a good job. No doubt this will become the next hollywood saga.</p>

But I was very pleasantly surprised! Of course it's hard to enjoy the sometimes shaky camera work, but I would never let that ruin the film for me (David...). I found the lead up to the actual arena was making me feel on edge and nervous as the trubutes would and I loved the contrast between the Capitols commentary and the harsh reality the districts endured. Overall I highly reccommend it to everyone!</p>

The only enjoyable part of this movie was the trailer for Prometheus.  Don't be fooled by how good the books are, because this movie is trash.  If you like this sort of genre and are hungry for more try reading Stephen King's The Long Walk.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[10]]<br/>Your review was poorly researched, showed little understanding of this story being the first part of three and demonstrated that you are out of touch with younger generations.The shaky camera increased the immediacy of the events, the violence was confusing because violence is confusing. The tributes were not fleshed out because Katniss needed to depersonalise them to succeed as a tribute. There was no romance because Katniss was convinced that either she or Peter would die and, if you take the time to read the books, you will see where all this leads. I give your review 1 star.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[10]]<br/>Oh David, oh Margaret.... Such an ill considered review. Rarely have I seen a book so captivatingly translated from page to screen. I found the film incredibly moving, compelling and credible. It captures the sense of desperation and confusion of the citizens of Panem so well, and I think the different narrative style only adds to the richness of our experience of the story. And the violence is faceless and awful, which is entirely the point. I also found the actors well cast, the soundtrack added to the pacing of the story, and the film did not become soppily sentimental.</p>

And is it really that hard to read the books before watching the movies? Harry potter was extremely difficult to read your reviews. I'm not sure why you bothered...<br/>As for the movie, the shaky cam really hurt my viewing. And I'm a fan of blair witch, Cloverfield etc. I couldnt tell who was who like everyone else.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>I'm going to have to be the first to insist they watch it again. The shaky cam was barely an issue. Even as someone who only read half the book (and quite some time ago) I have to say this is an incredibly faithful, and quite gripping, adaptation. It leaves the book behind. I think it's worth the hype.<br/>Surprised! Usually I agree with either one or the other.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>Loved it. The audience clapped at the end, it got oohs in the right spots, and the obligatory teenage giggles in the romance scenes. It never lost focus on Katniss's resourcefulness, her rightful resentment and sense of loss, so was a powerful, single-minded movie. We got to really care what happened, and what more could we ask?</p>

Too rushed. Kill, move on, kill, move on. In the book, there is a real bloodbath right at the start. IMO, its the best battle scene.  Tributes dying left and right, Katniss almost gets killed. but the whole scene was rushed &amp; finished in under a minute.  After that they devote alot of time shooting Katniss hiking in the woods! What a waste!  Jennifer Lawrence is good though.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[7]]<br/>The original book by Suzanne Collins was constantly stimulating, which doesn't transfer well onto celluloid. While the movie was almost identical to how I imagined the book, it just kind of 'sits there' when there's no dialogue. The suspense and the violence felt neutered. It should have challenged the audiences with questionable incidents. Sure, the high society of the Capitol has questionable morals, but none of that is portrayed in a in-your-face-obvious kind of way, which I would have preferred. I'm not sure the book makes a good movie, despite the book being so good.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[2]]<br/>I seriously doubt that anyone here who has given this movie more than 3 stars knows the first thing about good film making. This movie was absolutely atrocious, aside from some decent acting by the lead. No doubt the books are better (they would have to be), but that's irrelevant - the movie should be judged on its own merits. It was clearly a film for those under 15 years of age, but unfortunately it too often seemed like it was directed by a teenager as well. Almost made Twilight look good.</p>

The bloody gore bits and fighting could have been more intense though, and I do agree that the rough  hand held cam corder bits were to confusing and I found them annoying. But overall, I think it was a success.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[9]]<br/>I can't believe the rating that you gave this. I found the books great &amp; found this movie a fantastic adaptation. I also dispute the representation of these films as being suitable only for female 12 year-olds as I am a 30 year-old teacher. My husband also enjoyed the movie, even though he has not read the books.<br/><br/>I was particularly disgusted with this review after comparing it to your Twilight review where for some reason you thought that film was actually decent... If any film is a joke that was. Won't be looking to you for advice again.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[5]]<br/>Great review. This is why At The Movies kicks arse; no sycophantic raving; just independant critique. Love it. I find it amusing some adults are posting claims the books aren't aimed at teenagers because they read them. The fact is they are aimed at teenagers &amp; these ppl's rapt enjoyment of them says more about their level of literacy &amp; taste then anything else. I loved the themes, but it could have been much better. As for violence, books 4 adolescents r allowed to be more graphic then films 4 adolsecents; a problem encountered by the Potter &amp; Twilight series.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[7]]<br/>I think 1.5 stars and 2 stars is just a little extreme...<br/><br/>I actually think they did a really good job, and followed the book really closely. It was really interesting the way they chose to portray some things and I liked the way they included some of the background scenes with Seneca Crane - setting it up really well for the next movie.<br/><br/>Really inconsistent reviewing from Margaret and David!</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[9]]<br/>This is one of the worst reviews I've ever read from D&amp;M - they appear to have completely missed the point of the movie.  Anyone familiar with the book would know that for a true portrayal, this should never have been a "large scale action film", and fortunately, it isn't.  Yes, there is action, but it's there to make a point, not to BE the point.<br/><br/>I would have liked to have  seen more development of the relationship between Katniss and Rue, and a slightly slower build of the Katniss/Peeta The cast is well chosen.  And Jennifer Lawrence's performance oustanding.</p>

I'm usually a huge fan of yours, and always refer to your reviews before forking out the fortune it costs to see a movie in Melbourne.<br/>This movie is exceptionally well cast. Performances are excellent. The movie is a visual feast, the capitol is better than I imagined. Best of all they kept the movie disturbingly dark without being grotesque.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[10]]<br/>I'm sorry to compare this to twilight, but you've given me no other choice with the terrible rating you've given the hunger games. So you guys rate twilight 4 &amp; 3 and 1/2 stars and hunger games 1 and 1/2 and 2 stars. Honestly im so dissapointed in you guys.I really did think Gary Ross did an amazing job with this movie to capture the books essence on screen. Unlike twilight which was incredibly corny, the camera work was just dark and I  could barely see &amp; not to mention the terrible acting. You have really gotten this review wrong.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[4]]<br/>I was so disappointed in this movie. How can a 2.5 hr movie feel rushed? This one did. All of the characters were so underdeveloped that you did not feel anything for them. The Katniss Rue relationship was so rushed that it was hard to understand Katniss' extreme grief. And why would District 11 know District 12's salute? The Mockingjay's significance was not explained. There was only a brief glimpse of the girl on fire costume. The cornucopia did not look like a cornucopia. The muttatations did not possess the psychological terror as those in the book.  Just bad!</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[3]]<br/>Atrocious hand held camera work backed up by the most awful editing ever seen did not make this movie a pleasurable viewing experience.On paper the story sounded great but it certainly did not translate well to screen,noisy,confusing,garish,what a mess! Jennifer Lawrences acting was ok but her character definition was so seriously lacking that it was a bad joke. The soppy ending was the contrived sugar coated ending that I guess this mess deserved,I was going to read the books but this movie has changed my mind.</p>

Didn't think it is too long either, and appreciated the fact that it has a conclusion in itself, but leaves you wanting more. When Lawrence was on screen, I couldn't look away - she's mesmerising. Ultimately, it really made me want to read the books--looking forward to that!</p>

But i think its clear from not just my opinion, but from the others that have commented that you have gotten it wrong this time. I'm not a 'teen' but a 20 year old male who has adored the book series, and from watching it today I can proudly say they have brought my favourite book to life in the best way possible. Either you were watching completely different film or weren't paying enough attention. Seriously David one and a half stars? And Margaret 2 stars. What were you thinking?</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[4]]<br/>I really wanted to like this movie. Jennifer was excellent.<br/><br/>The shaky cam was disgusting. I actually made David's exact remark towards the end about not being able to distinguish the characters' gender.<br/><br/>Why should the review take the book into account at all - it doesn't stand up on it's own merit. The book doesn't change the fact that this is lazy film making. <br/><br/>Be objective, do yourself a favour and see Battle Royale instead. That's where the idea was stolen from, an original which was wonderfully fleshed out.  I'm offended by this franchise's popularity.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[7]]<br/>I just watched the film a few hours ago, and although some parts were excellently executed, character development was lacking. Jennifer played Katniss well; I felt Peeta was missing something and that because there were so many characters it was difficult to establish connections with them. Capitol scenes weren't done as well  as they could've- and the constant switch backs to Caesar commentating was overdone. The Seneca storyline was great. So much potential with such an experienced cast was wasted.<br/>Overall happy with the district 12 scenes and the actual 'games' . Hopefully the next film will be even better!</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[10]]<br/>Im surprised by people who have read the book are disappointed by the lack of presence by both Lenny Kravitz and Donald Sutherland.  The character of Cinna is only in the first half of the book, and has no purpose once the game has started.  Also too, Sutherland's character appeared much more than in the novel.  I believe it stayed true to the book and but also had its own special elements, such as behind the scenes of the games.  I was amazed by this movie and will enjoy watching it again and again!</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>I disagree greatly with the reviews given. I went to the movie withno expectations with a group of twenty one to twenty five year olds and we all came out saying that was good. The males enjoyed it more than the girls, but we girls liked it too. I prefer toned down violence, as I do not have a stomach for too much killing. I think they did it elegantly and it reflected the story despite not being in first person. I give it 4/5</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[7]]<br/>I'm a little confused how you can rate 21 Jump St higher than this? I can't seem to get past Chaning Tatum's frozen face and monotone voice..<br/><br/>..Anyway, having not read the novels, I enjoyed this movie. I would not say it's anything amazing, and, can see how the younger generations hype (as with twilight) will automatically put a downer on the film for some, but it was very entertaining. I can agree the battle scenes were terrible, but this for me was the only severe down fall.<br/><br/>Jennifer was a great lead, I look forward to reading the books.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[3]]<br/>The movie lacked the extra layer of depth of the book, that would be hard for your average 15 year-old to get. Older readers would be disappointed that it didn't bring home a strong message that the capitol is evil and how disturbing this post-apocalyptic world is. <br/><br/>They have targeted it for a teenage population which would make sense as it is a teenage book, but I'm sure they aren't stupid and know that lots of adults have read it. This movie would just seem like a floosy and lackluster in depth if u havnt read it. <br/></p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[3]]<br/>The movie omits small crucial detail from the book that adds immense depth to the story and I dont understand why.  For example, the dogs at the end are meant to have the faces of the dead tributes. This is obviously very evil on behalf of the capitol - haunt those left with those you killed. But this was ommited.How hard would it have been to computer generate the victims faces and show a short scene where katniss receives the bread from district 11 and have madge give katniss the pin?</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>I agree that 'The Hunger Games' has visual flaws, especially in camerawork. . <br/><br/>However, as someone who adored the books, I can only praise the filmmakers behind the interpretation. They captured the subtle political and physical horrors intertwined in the nature of the Games to the best of their ability, no doubt restricted by the film's rating. <br/><br/>Not perfect, but nothing ever can be considering it's such a popular text.<br/><br/>I'm simply glad a story of real substance and meaning is on our screens, instead of the alternative "teen" trash Hollywood favours. Isn't that the most important thing - the story?</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[6]]<br/>I agree with all the points Chris makes. The result is an okay movie, which should in fact soar.<br/><br/>The shaky cam in the first 30 minutes is really annoying, but it does get better later on (barring the fight scenes). And I feel the emotional punches are largely missing as a direct result of the American PG-13 rating it was forced to squeeze into. It seriously looks like the film was censored with heavy-handed editing. I only hope that they learn from this huge mistake.<br/><br/>The average age of the audience I saw this with was ~30. 50/50 Male/Female.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[10]]<br/>This film was stunningly good.<br/><br/>The film is told from Katniss's point of view, so everything from the sound, music, picture is all supporting that point of view. The action scenes that Margaret and David are complaining about are deliberately confusing, because Katniss at that time is confused.<br/><br/>I find it genuinely surprising that people who review films for a living could miss this (especially given the nature of the sound design, which is rarely the literal sound. Every sound in the film has a point of view). Somehow the soul of this film went right over their heads.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[6]]<br/>Having read the book just a week before watching the movie, I unfortunately compared a lot &amp; didn't enjoy it as much. As most reviews have noted, the biggest disappointment is that the movie failed to showcase Katniss's mind or the stirrings of her soul from a first-person narrative styled novel. I was also disappointed with the lack of visual blood and gore which I believe is crucial for the loss of humanity feeling which is prominent in the book. As a result, the movie seemed hasty and lacked the emotional roller coaster-like essence of the novel.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[5]]<br/>As a 28 year old woman, I loved all 3 books so much so that I read them twice within 2 weeks. My husband also read them and enjoyed them. We are not 'young teens'.The movie had it's high points. The acting. The reaping. However, I too felt that Lenny Kravitz and Donal Sutherland were wasted. I also believe they tried too hard to keep the M rating. Why not have it as MA and stay truer to the violence of the novel? The love story was rushed. It was subtle and pure in the book.</p>

I cried within the first half an hour and two times after that and I'm a teenage guy. The film was funny and sad and moving and was a blockbuster with a lot of heart (which is hard to find these days). Jennifer Lawrence was outstanding in her portrayal of Katniss and all the supporting actors and actresses (yes, all of them) were equally as excellent. I cannot wait to see it again!</p>

The film is fine, but could have been a lot better. The shaky camera work and the quick editing was dreadful, and some of the stuff ups of book-to-film stuff were annoying, but other than that it was fine. It was enjoyable and worth seeing, but ultimately the book is better. I was annoyed D&amp;M didn't even mention the CG work, though with what they did mention it wouldn't have been positive.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>Personally, I believe that if you have not even READ the book, you have no right making comparisons to the movie. Judge how it was filmed and produced all you like, but the plot belongs to Suzanne Collins, not the director. Also, it's unfair to say it was directed at young girls. Yes, there is a love triangle, but this isn't Twilight. There is no accurate way to stereotype the fan base because it is so diverse, and the story latches on to everyone's inner instinct that war is cruel and awful. Next time, do your homework.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[9]]<br/>Normally have great respect for M&amp;D and can see where their criticisms are coming from even when I don't agree with them, but in this case they're just plain wrong. This film is fantastic and totally exceeded my expectations. It's tense, gripping, extremely well acted (Jennifer Lawrence in particuar is amazing), and faithful to the source material without getting bogged down by it. It's a strong film in its own right even for people who haven't read the books. I really can't even understand why they'd give a review like this especially considering most other critics have been extremely positive.</p>

The setting was very well done and the acting was great.  I much prefer that than the Twilight movies that's for sure.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>I don't agree either. Perhaps you would have felt differently if you'd read the books and found out more about the phenomenan beforehand, ie the target audience. I loved it and couldn't believe 2.5 hours had passed. The only thing I would recommend is for people to not sit too close - in row E I felt a bit sick from the action - but you're meant to, it's the point. Incidently I'm in my early 40s and loved Melacholia and Burning Man. But I do love a good blockbuster I thought this was one of the better ones.</p>

Really interesting, complex story with great acting (particularly from Jennifer Lawrence) to go with it. <br/><br/>I don't see why Margret and and David rated it so low when everywhere else the reviews are very positive. It seems they are (once again) just dismissing the story as another 'teen' franchise and missing the whole point.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>I disagree completely with you review, Also think it's horribly discussed . I feel you've completely missed the direction of the movie and the book series, less violence, more overall political meanings which are relevant in today's society ( think Libya and Egypt) are focused on heavily here. Also I disagree with your opinions on the lack of violence... do we really need to resort to blood baths for audience entertainment. (The snake wrangler was used to control the snakes in the area they filmed in) and the books aren't aimed at just young women either.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[9]]<br/>In the 10+ years that I've been watching the show, I have never been as shocked as I was from your reviews of this movie. The shaky cam is extremely effective, the score is incredible, all the characters are incredibly appealing (I think I'm now in love with Jennifer Lawrence) and the adaptation to the screen is so faithful. Could almost say that it is better than all the Harry Potter movies. If I had to complain about something, it would be that the final 30 minutes felt too rushed. Would have happily sat there for another 30 minutes.</p>

The language is sloppy, the tone is bored, they're disrespecting a really great movie that means a lot to some people. Not happy M&amp;D. I thought the movie was very moving, exciting, different and all together worthwhile. It is a strong adaption and the actors fulfill their roles as they should.

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>Yes the queesy-cam is annoying to begin with but eases up after awhile. Jennifer Lawrence is amazing, the story is deeply realised and the other performances work really well. I disagree with Margaret that the translation from 1st to 3rd person (book- movie) is a problem - the close-up shakycam action sequences are effective in conveying the terror/shock/chaos of the 1st person perspective. Deserves way more credit than 2 stars! Seriously.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[4]]<br/>I agree with the review...the action scenes are terribly shot and edited. Outside of the two main characters, the other players are faceless evil drones with no personality what so ever. The CGi is AWFUL. There's no real reason to engage with the story when your not given too much of a reason to engage with the characters. It's far too long for its own good.<br/><br/>the only interesting thing about it is the outside politics<br/><br/>Skip this and go watch the Superior Kinji Fukusaku film Battle Royale...its far more engaging and compelling then this could ever be.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[10]]<br/>A confronting and well-created world is experienced in this film. The chilling atmosphere is created through subtlety and a build up that cuts through with a staggeringly violent yet controlled mid-way climax. The acting is superb, even from the short sequences appreciated from Harrelson, Sutherland and Tucci. But the real star is Laurence, who is believable and relatable as the lead.<br/>As for the shaky camera, I believe it was put to good use. Honestly, did you really want to see the detail of what was going on in those fights?<br/>The conclusion is cleverly off-beat.<br/>You must see this film!</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[5]]<br/>The film was entertaining, i did enjoy myself, and Jennifer Lawrence is excellent, but this film had quite a few big problems. The shakey camera work was diaboloical. I was close to giving up on it after 30 mins in which the camera had not stayed put for long enough to even make out the characters. Thankfully this improved in the later parts, but not to the point that you could follow the critical scenes. Small parts of the story are interesting, but mostly it is very familiar, and apart from Katniss there is no effort at character development.</p>

It's obvious you haven't read the books nor viewed this movie impartially in the first place, and I'm really disappointed you both bought in to the hype of this film - by choosing to be negative.

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>I really enjoyed it. I thought it was a pretty accurate portrayal of the books.<br/><br/>I went to the midnight screening and sat a bit too close to the screen so I do agree about the filming. It took some serious adjustment. But it's likely the filming style was used at least in part because the Games were meant to be televised across the country, so it was trying to reflect sort of a deadly action version of Big Brother.<br/><br/>Overall though I really, really enjoyed it. I think they did the books justice.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[3]]<br/>For me the book was - well I thought I coulda spent the time better flossing my teeth for 5 or 6 hours.  Sorry to those who loved it, I just felt the writer's anxiety too much as she struggled to come up with the next plot twist to keep it limping along for another chapter.  As a wannabe writer I know well the feeling. <br/><br/>And there was a sequel?  No way, that plot had to be beyond resuscitation.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[4]]<br/>As a huge fan of the books I was surprisingly disappointed as well. The arena is meant to be the place of nightmares therefore why do the tributes look like they have come back from an enjoyable hiking trip? the impact is so low and the satirical aspect is barely there. It felt as if none of the danger was translated on screen i.e - it feels like another clique teen movie.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[4]]<br/>I'm with ya Dave. Too many poorly crafted plot holes and a lack of suspense. The sponsorship element should have been explored further in order to make a statement about our reality-tv generation and the nature of voyeurism, but instead it was blindsided by an uncomfortable romance and characters who turn on a dime for seemingly no reason. Love your work Stratton!</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[3]]<br/>I have read the book, which is not greatly written but is an ok read. Saw the film today and was frankly bored. Am surprised at the positive reviews it's getting and am glad to see D&amp;M not getting swept up in the hype. I'm not sure it's going to satisfy even the teenage girl market as, beyond Jennifer Lawrence, there's not much there for them to engage with. There's very little spark between Jennifer and Josh, even if it is meant to be half-pretended. Finally, bad pacing and bad camera work.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>I always read your reviews Margaret and David but you have severely missed the point with this one. I am a 25 year old male who is a fan of the books and thoroughly enjoyed the movie thinking it was a faithful adaption which will leave the fans and newcomers sadisfied. While not a perfect movie, it was well acted particularly by its lead, had some powerful scenes, good use of satire and good editing that makes the violence from the book more implicit rather than explicit and thus more easily digestible.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[7]]<br/>As someone who has read the books I agree with a lot of what your saying about the shaky camerawork and would have liked to see more of Peeta and Katniss's growing relationship portrayed in the story. The ending also felt quite rushed compared to the powerful start. Despite this, the film was perfectly cast and managed to balance out the horror of teenagers forced to kill one another and the tyranny of the capitol. Yes, it is flawed, but overall I feel it did the book justice.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[9]]<br/>This review is close-minded and uninformed.  Unfortunately, they seem to have made their mind up before seeing the movie, as well, assuming it was intended your young teenage girls, and making irrelevant points, like:  why was the Australian not featured more, and where were those snakes?  You are making assumptions about the the content of the books being "very nasty", and assuming this "very nasty" content was "watered down" for the movie to appeal to teenage girls... Sad, but your assumptions about the book, and subsequent hypotheses as to why the movie was not more violent completely miss the point.<br/></p>

Most of the kids got killed off screen. Any of the kids the Katniss and Peeta killed were set up as evil.<br/><br/>3) No explorations of the morality of the characters actions. Katniss and Peeta never had to make any kind of morally dubious decisions.<br/><br/>Lenny Kravitz's character confused me.

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[9]]<br/>I strongly disagree with Margaret and Dave. The book isn't aimed at 12 year old girls, it is a teen book. - in saying that, i know many adults who have read the book numerous amounts of times. I am a 22 year old male and i really enjoyed it. I don't think you should be basing the film on the book if you haven't read it! I think that you have also made a very uninformed rating on the movie because i have seen it and i think it is one of the best movies i have ever watched.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[7]]<br/>Why did you dislike it so? I don't understand why there is no discussion of the actual movie here. <br/>The movie brought the story to life in a pretty thorough way - it was certainly more accomplished than pictures made from famous novels usually are. I think the essence of freedom could have been emphasised more in the opening scenes, and they could have taken more risks with the actual filmmaking - especially since it's such an exciting, important story. But it's worth a see purely for Jennifer Lawrence - she is unbelievably affective and masterful in her craft.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>As someone who has read the book, I can say I disagree with Margaret and David. The book has a massive audience, ranging from 12 year old girls AND boys to 18 year olds. I agree that they had to tune down the violence but the implied brutality is still effective. The movie is amazingly faithful to the books, something I'm grateful for because it had such a wonderful story and message. Jennifer Lawrence is flawless as Katniss and she captures the spirit of the character perfectly. All in all, I loved it.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>Those who have read the books would understand that the film adaption has been dulled down as it is a graphic novel, but putting that aside it isn't entirley what this story is about and action wasn't intended to be its forte. The story is more angled on the desperation and struggle of poorer districts using their wits and cunning to survive. Against the capitols tyrannic rule demanding entertainment<br/>It is in this sense that Katniss disagrees and decides she isn't a pawn in their games and is forced to bend the rules. infuriating the capitol, and giving others hope</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>Wow, all the reviews so far of this movie have been overwhelmingly positive. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and though it did a good job of representing the books. The books were amazing and I imagine either David and Margaret completely missed the point of this series or they're simply not the right age group to enjoy/understand it. David and Margaret are usually spot on with their review however this is one time I strongly disagree with them.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Hunger Games))[[8]]<br/>Margaret &amp; David are a little harsh in their review!  I'm very disappointed in such short shrift.  Although I admit it would be hard to engage for those who have not read the books, and think its only a "teen movie" or a "large-scale action" story.  Its not.  From the books, I expected the violence and action scenes to be amateurish, as they are portrayed in the books.  More like an alternate version of the film, 'Battle Royale'.   If the Hunger Games arena had been filmed slick Hollywood style, it would have destroyed a major theme of the story. <br/><br/></p>

I'm a big fan of the books and I thought this movie was tense, exhilarating and lightly satirical to boot. <br/>I mean seriously, did you not enjoy the fantastic interview scenes nor Stanley Tucci's fantastic performance as Caesar Flickerman? Or Jeniffer Lawrence's perfect embodiment of Katniss? Or the haunting bloodbath at the Cornucopia?! There are so many good things about this film that I cant even begin to contemplate how you rated it so low.</p>
