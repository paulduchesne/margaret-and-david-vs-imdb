<h3>Gerry</h3>
<p><em>Review by Margaret Pomeranz</em></p>
<p>I saw Gus van Sant’s film ‘Elephant’ in Cannes last year where it surprisingly won the Palm d’Or. I was intrigued by the style of the film and was told then that it followed on from his previous film ‘Gerry’ which had at that stage not had a release in Australia. <br/><br/>Well, ‘Elephant’ has come and gone and now ‘Gerry’ is enjoying a limited release here. Starring Matt Damon and Casey Affleck who are credited as co-writers along with van Sant it’s about two young men called ‘Gerry’ who leave their car and wander off in the desert to find something they only describe as ‘the thing’. <br/><br/>When they decide to return to their car, the path back has disappeared. They become lost for days. They are literally figures in a landscape. <br/><br/>Their limited conversations verge on absurdist, their journey pointless. This is not cinema for everyone, particularly not for devotees of commercial cinema, but I found ‘Gerry’ as intriguing and interesting as ‘Elephant’. <br/><br/>The textures of the images, the lack of dramatic events, the elusive significance of anything became more and more mesmerising. Don’t say you weren’t warned but I’m giving ‘Gerry’ 4 stars.</p>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i> I could relate to the familiarity the two ‘Gerry’s’ shared with each other and found their friendship to be realistic and, in the beginning stages of the film, humorous and enjoyable. However, that’s where the enjoyment ended for me. It was so painfully realistic that I felt like I was watching reality TV. When something exciting, interesting or intriguing happened it was great but I spent most of my time in utter frustration in anticipation of those moments to occur. I did not enjoy the uncomfortable, drawn out, 15 minute long ‘walking scenes’ and the phrase ‘I get your point’ and ‘this is getting ridiculous’ sprung to mind on many occasions throughout the film. Even waiting for the credits to end was painful! I couldn’t wait to get out of the cinema</p>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i> If only it was that simple to make art movies. Showing 15 minute long shots of men walking or sleeping is not cinema. These guys should do painting instead. OK their friendship is superficial and they are stuck when they really need to communicate but is this worth a movie?</p>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i> Inevitabilty. Having seen both Elephant and Last Days before Gerry it's sort of like reading a book backwards. To say that the silence was deafening would be to much. Superb cinematography shows they are lost in America, Is America lost? Has it gone of the track? Slowly, as in both Elephant and Last Days we know what is going to happen, must happen. Van Sant is pushing the boundries again, finally.</p>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i> An astonishing film in which the inability of men to communicate on an emotional level with each other is highlighted by the spare, abstract landscape. Like a good piece of music, this film takes time to make its point -- but is a deeply moving and sensitively explored. Not to be missed</p>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i> This would have to be the pinnancle of "Art Cinema" - a great movie that HAD to be made but never should be WATCHED.<br/><br/>I've been lost in the desert and, believe me, you do not behave the way the two Gerrys did. Only city-slickers could believe that this story was any sort of indication of human behaviour (see also "Japanese Story").<br/><br/>If anything, it's a stoner movie - I mean "Dirt mattress"?</p>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i> I couldn't take my eyes off Gerry, which was both great and frustrating (it's tricky pouring tea without looking) but thankfully there were enough quiet patches to talk with my sister and relieve some of the, well quietness I guess (we discussed what we'd do if "rock marooned"). The scenery and score (although minimal) go so well together I probably could have watched this minus Casey Affleck and Matt Damon. That's not to say the two aren't terrific in this! The final 20 minutes or so were so mesmerising for me I could barely breathe, and the film left me with a "wow". My sister and I both thought it hilarious that any of our friends (and family, minus dad) would have turned it off within 2 minutes. I say, if you liked Elephant and Last Days, you shoul</p>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i> I REALLY didn't want to see this movie but my husband who loved it, made me and I'm glad he did. Yes, the movie has limited dialogue and yes, it moves very slowly but it sure does pull you in. The scenery and music are at times heartbreakingly beautiful and because the moments of dialogue and action are so rare, they seem to take on more importance. My main critisism is that it's hard to care about the characters since you know so little about them and they behave quite stupidly.<br/><br/>This is not a movie for action addicts but it is worthwhile if you can stand the pace.<br/><br/>For those who watch it on DVD - take note of the timer moving. When I watched it, the disc had a hiccup and paused and it took us a minute to realise it!</p>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i> I think I missed something...? I'm not usually one for action or commercial films, Howeverm have to agree with Dave - this one left me lost in the desert as well - dying for relief. I went and washed the dishes and it was much more enjoyable</p>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i> I thought elephant was a major achievement from gus van sant, it had a haunting and poetic style. Gerry is similarly minimalistic in story yet somehow says so much. Highly Recommended from me</p>

<i><strong>Remarks:</strong></i> Just dreadful. An advertisement for all that is wrong with "art house" cinema. People feel compelled to say they liked this or be accused of selling out their anti-hollywood ideals.</p>
