<h2>Les MisÚrables</h2>
<p><em>Review by David Stratton</em></p>
<p>Following the great success of THE KING'S SPEECH, director Tom Hooper scores again with this handsomely made film of Claude-Michel Schonberg's and Alain Boublil's stage musical of Victor Hugo's LES MISERABLES. Hugo's great story about the implacable pursuit by policeman Javert of noble ex-convict Jean Valjean, has been faithfully brought to the screen, with impressive sets, well-staged action, and welcome comedy contributions from Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as a couple of Dickensian reprobates. Hugh Jackman is a superb Valjean, and Anne Hathaway, is magnificent as Fantine. Some may be troubled by the casting of non-singer Russell Crowe as Javert, but he gives a strong performance and just about gets by vocally.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Mis´┐Żrables))[[9]]<br>I thought it was wonderful and am  sure it will stand the test of time.<br>The singing was intended to be part of the movie it was not meant to stand out too much ,as this would remove us from our immersion in the screen reality. (This comment was roughly as quoted by someone involved in the making of the movie.)<br/></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Les Mis´┐Żrables))[[8]]<br>I quite liked it but Russell Crowe shouldn't have sung. At all. I found myself checking my watch every time he started a song. I found towards the end it got a bit too long, but it was very good otherwise.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[10]]<br>Finished the book two months before the movie came out and loved seeing Victor Hugo's characters come to life on the big screen (saw it twice). The story is fantastic and with its themes of love and redemption it was so easy to be captured by this film  from start to finish. The singing was wonderful with beautiful versions of "I Dreamed A Dream" and "On My Own". Loved every moment.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[1]]<br>Bloody Awful!!  and I have been a BIG Les Mis fan since the first time i saw it in Sydney with Normie Rowe, Philip Quast ...which was just breathtakingly awsome!!  This movie adaptation is just pure sewage. Horrible, and an insult to the stage productions everywhere. Everything about this movie stank! The singing, acting, ESPECIALLY Russell Crowe! (What a weak performance). I can't believe this movie is getting 4 and 5 star ratings.<br><br>Just Horrible.</br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[8]]<br>I too, avoided this on the big screen. Had heard it was a marathon to get through. How untrue. Visually spectacular and sure, it wasn't sung as well as some stage productions, but what the heck. After a while I didn't even mind Russell.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[9]]<br>I have avoided this film as musicals are really not my genre of film I seek...but I was blown away by this film..it was sumptious visually and I wished I had seen it on the big screen..Anne Hathaway was brilliant as Fantine and her performance of that killer song "I had a dream" made the hairs on the back of my neck bristle..it was magnificent!! Hugh Jackman gets a lot of hype but he truly lives up to it in this film as Valjean.The supporting cast were also wonderful.I did feel however Russell Crowe was miscast as Javert.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[8]]<br>I just watched it on DVD and I wish I'd seen it at the cinema when it first came out. It's ambitious stuff that doesn't disappoint. I was impressed that the cast sang live on camera and none of their vocals are perfect  - which I thought added to the performances. Hathaway is excellent of course, but the acting kudos really should go to Hugh Jackman and Crowe, who are both outstanding. Sacha Baron Cohen is a surprise in this - and steals every scene he is in.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[3]]<br>Beautifully presented, visually enthralling, great colour, fabulous sets, make-up and costumes. A gifted set of actors enacting one of Victor Hugo masterpieces. <br>But why, oh why, do the actors have to sing every line? Drove me crazy! Musicals are for performers who can sing - just like dancing is for those who can dance. <br>What's next? Swan Lake starring Kirsten Dunst &amp; Johnny Depp?</br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[1]]<br>Great opening, good sets and costumes but it just went sharply downhill from there. Woeful casting in lead roles. Russell Crowe was beyond bad and Hugh Jackman struggled. Their performances were so poor it was hard to see beyond them to gain any enjoyment. The songs were truly mediocre and tedious, not at all memorable.  <br>When Russell Crowe wandered endlessly along a parapet, it was hard not to leap out of my seat and push him off.</br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[10]]<br>An amazing interpretation of a wonderful story of love,grace and redemption. I held off seeing the film in the cinema for reasons that, now, are beyond me. Anne Hathaway's performance almost sent shivers down my spine! Her rendition of "I Dreamed a Dream" lifted this wonderful actress into the realm of greatness.<br>I was touched by many of the lines but, as an old romantic, I was moved by "Love is a garden for the young" - sad, but true. The finale delivered just the lift we all needed at the end of a rich and full production.  JG</br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[3]]<br>greatly overrated. Only 1 great singer In movie - The priest (Colm Wilkinson).<br>Words were changed from original and the pitch of the songs changed to try and not embarrass the non singers in the cast.<br>Why  would they have such poor singers in the film is hard to understand. They should have stuck with the original score. More could have been done with the screenplay. Very disappointing.</br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[10]]<br>An excellent, wonderful, breathtaking movie,  Russell Crowe was impressive and strong in his role even if his voice is not especial, Hugh Jackman was incredible, Anne Hathaway was superb, and all the other actors were very good in their performances. The sets were so real, you could feel you were there, the rotting ships where people lived, the elegant and the poor areas.<br><br>The music was awesome, I was unhappy when the movie finished, I wanted it to go on and on and on. Not a fan of musicals with no dialogues, only singing, but this movie was incredible.</br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[3]]<br>Good - production design, Anne Hathaway, the source material<br><br>The Bad - One would assume the first rule of a musical would be to get good singers. Russell Crowe &amp; Amanda Seyfried were straining, Hugh Jackman had an ugly, nasally vibrato the whole time, Eddie Redmayne sounded like a Muppet, Cohen &amp; Carter were inaudible etc. The live singing, which they turned into a big selling point, severely limited the direction, bring me to...<br><br>The Ugly -Too many edits; intrusive close-ups; claustrophobic camerawork. 2 hr 40 min of constant singing? Yikes - at least have good sound mixing.</br></br></br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[8]]<br/>I found this a rollicking and mesmerising affair for the most part, lively and impassioned, and the pained emotional seesawing of the story captured well. Did not care that Russell Crowe had no vibrato, he sang in tune and had a great, muscular, menacing presence as Javert. Hugh Jackman was fantastic, those who say he was unconvincing, are you alive? And miscast, keep your day jobs, there's a reason you're not casting agents! Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter were a lot of well-acted fun as the Dickensian in dress, Shakesperean comic relief act. Photography was a tad conventional.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[8]]<br/>A most entertaining film.  Acting brilliant and convincing.  I liked Russell Crowe's manly expressive voice and don't know why he's been criticised so much.  I didn't find the film depressing, although there were poignant moments there was also humour and the sets were spectacular.</p>

There was not a dry eye in the theater when I went to see it. Russell Crowe was a knock out, I wasn't disappointed. Anne Hathaway should've been nominated for the best actress for the Oscars. She was phenomenal. Hugh Jackman was amazing, but not better than Russell of course. The casting was fantastic and I just can't wait for it to come out on DVD because I will buy it. I was depressed for an entire week though. It was sad!</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[3]]<br/>For those that know the stage show: <br/>Hugh's a great musical baritone, so big chunks of (Valjean's tenor) role were lowered up to a third so he could do it.  <br/>Russell - oh dear. While Javert is a baritone role, even key parts of it were lowered - and he still couldn't do it. <br/>If you wondered why some of the students and the soldier who sang, "You at the barricade listen to this ..." sounded so good, it's because they actually were from recent stage show casts - so can actually sing. ;)</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[9]]<br/>I saw the stage show twice - in London and in Melbourne with Anthony Warlow. I was mesmerised by Hugh Jackman's performance and deeply moved by the film. I was therefore surprised to read a coterie of reviews that seemed to be vying with each other to find fault.<br/>Thank you to Margaret and David for restoring my faith in my judgment! Very pleased Anne Hathaway was rewarded, disappointed but not surprised Jackman did not pick up an Oscar for what would be, I suspect, the challenge of his career.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[2]]<br/>This movie, basically done the Hollywood way is a total flop!<br/><br/>I think a lot of Westerners have not heard of Les Miserables, and therefore it being sung added a lot of confusion as to the plot.<br/><br/>Bad casting, such as Hugh Jackman to play Valjean - empty and unconvincing, but a decent singer, Russell Crowe - stick to acting because singing isn't your strength. But these two character need big chemistry to pull through the film, which didn't happen in this movie!<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway, she's a good singer and played Fantine convincingly, best actress in the movie. <br/><br/>Great setting.<br/>One star.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[4]]<br/>Two huge flaws in this - the decision to have virtually all of it sung rather than spoken; and very poor casting. If you are going to make singing so important, you need good singers. Good acting wouldn't go astray.  Russell Crowe was right for his part but Jackman was not convincing.  Anne Hathaway - not very strong at the best of times - managed to do a workmanlike job of the 'aria' she had to sing, but was only adequate in the role. I know why they bothered to make it - box office was almost guaranteed.</p>

It is still amazing, albiet the makeup, particularly as he was a pop singer at the time.  Had forgotten Marina Prior, Peter Cousens and Robyn Arthur were also in it.<br/><br/>The film is still resonating with me and will see it again as Eponine was a standout and the handsome student leader impressive! Although was a little disappointed with Amanda Seyfried as Cosette.<br/><br/>And to Hugh, Anne and Russel - EXCELLENTE!</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[9]]<br/>Please note, this isn't the musical. People going into the movie expecting pitch perfect singing have seriously got the concept wrong in their heads. This is a film first and foremost a muscial second. The cast don't belt out every song, they sing it in context to the emotions of the characters. Why would a starving and weak Fantine blast out a song like a fat opera singer? <br/><br/>Watch it for the emotions and acting and singing and it is a brilliant film. If you want singing only, go buy a CD, this is a film, deal with it.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[10]]<br/>I like football, meat pies, kangaroos and AstonMartins (sorry Holden). I'm not a great film goer let alone musicals. Honestly, I invited a lovely lady to this movie with the shallow intention of impressing her enough with my faux "soft" side so as to have my way with her later that evening. A movie experience I shall long remember. As a knuckle dragging male I connected immediately with the physical/mental "fight" between Jackman and Crowe. Complete balls and bravery from the actors who could easily have made pulp cinema for more money. Thankyou from my now girlfriend and I.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[10]]<br/>What a wonderful film.  I read a comment that it was depressing - not at all, very sad at times and I cried a lot, but I also laughed at times.  I wouldn't have wanted the voices to be more 'operatic', the way it was done made everyone so real.  I will definitely see the film again and may venture to a stage production in the future but feel that may be a letdown after this magnificent production.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[8]]<br/>I enjoyed this lavishly presented period piece which shows the moving story of toughness of life for most of the population in the nineteenth century.  While the singing isn't consistently first class, it is adequate to good and did not detract from the effect.  It is a movie not a stage operatic musical.  The pace can feel a little slow at times - singing takes longer to get the story across than speaking.  Hugh Jackman is convincing as Valjean, Anne Hathaway sheds her glamour as Fantine, contracted with comedic roles from Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[7]]<br/>Well acted and well filmed. The singing was uneven though, with Hugh Jackman especially sorely tested. But it is a powerful story and difficult not to be moved by it, whether or not one loves the music. I think it is a mistake to call this a musical, it's really an opera, with every word sung - and yes that does mean endless (unmusical) recitatives. For me, the whole work would have been more successful as a musical, with 'arias' and choruses separated by spoken dialogue. But that's personal taste and not denigrating the movie. Glad to have experienced it</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[9]]<br/>At first I sat there thinking "this isn't going to work (shooting this beautiful musical into a film)" but slowly the film works its magic and it's as if you were sitting in the theatre watching the musical - only with the added effects, scenery and cinematography behind it. This probably is better than the musical. And the actors did a reasonable job singing their parts.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[4]]<br/>Havent seen the musical, took my mum who has and is a big fan.<br/>Overall I found it tedious. Singing all the way through was too much-even mum thought so. A couple of the songs were good and I liked the cinematography. Russell Crowe looked awkward. Helen B.C and Sacha B.C added comedic relief. Mum thought Hugh Jackman carried the movie and he was excellent. I found it odd when they were hiding from the enemy nearby, but then breaking into song! Mostly, whilst mum was sniffling away, I was rolling my eyes and looking at my watch!</p>

I would think it close on impossible to apply method acting in a musical but both main actors achieved it.<br/><br/>Very special film which paid due homage to the stage, a stunning score and an emotionally charged reminder of the courage of those who fight and sacrifice their lives for human rights.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe was solid but I found myself questioning his casting.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[5]]<br/>Disappointing.  Generally, actors become actors because they can, well, act.  Singers become singers because they have great voices and musicality.  The straining of thin voices from start to finish meant this simply failed to engage the soul emotionally.  Russell Crowe had the only resonant voice with colour and depth.  Freddie Mercury was completely bowled over by the beauty and richness of a trained voice the first time he heard opera.  Perhaps the director should have done likewise......<br/>The false sets were glaring; my daughter recognised Helena BC as the same character from Harry potter.... but Sacha BC was truly hilarious....</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[4]]<br/>The main problem with this musical is that the music is not very interesting. There are maybe three or four good songs and they are generally belted out as power ballads, even the reflective Empty Chairs. I was relieved when Russel Crowe dived off the bridge, since it meant no more monotonous recitative, well, at least not from him. The story telling is ponderous at best and the performances no better than competent.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[9]]<br/>Loved this movie! Yes, the singing was a bit flat in places but the actors showed real emotion while they were singing and I can imagine that (especially Anne Hathaway's I dreamed a dream number) it is very hard to show that deep emotion and sing perfectly. In real life who sings perfectly when they are emotional like that? Russel Crow did a great job and I didnt find him out of place at all. Only critism-you could tell at times that the background scenerary was not real but otherwise the best movie ive seen in a while.</p>

It is STUNNING, exhausting and utterly brilliant from beginning to end. I can hardly wait to see it again. Russel Crowe, despite what some critics say, it wonderful and perfectly cast in his role. This movie deserves every award the movie industry has. Thank you. We haven't seen a movie like his for a long time.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[10]]<br/>Took my 15 and 11 year old daughters to this with some nervousness.,,,but they loved it as much as I did. How could you not enjoy this, beautifual visually, wonderful performances, stirring and equisite music, an inspiring historic setting, young love and the hope and sacrifice of young rebellion. Hathaway was mesmerising, Jackman terrific and Crowe did well. The actress playing Eponine truly stole the show and the young actors were superb. Many tears amongst the 15 year old and I - loved it.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[10]]<br/>This movie version is worth seeing more than once.  I enjoyed it even more the 2nd time, when I was able to better appreciate all the things I missed before, such as just how well Hugh Jackman did the lead character and what an enormously demanding role it must've been.  Also, what I really loved about this compared to the stage productions I've seen was the magnificent orchestral music, the arrangements and the sound.  It was fresh, imaginative, and to my man-in-the-street ear, sublimely delivered.  I absolutely love the album and pray they'll make a full sound-track available soon.<br/><br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[3]]<br/>Having seen the stage production twice (in Sydney) many years ago I found the film flat, 2 dimensional. No oomph and too many closeups. Helena Bonham Carter was the highlight. For a film, the singing was ok (even Russell) but not a patch on the stage production where the feel of the characters was real. The animation/special effects in Life of Pi were far superior. This is a good example of where an excellent book and stage production fails as a movie.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[9]]<br/>I have seen 2 other film versions and the stage play with Peter Cousens as Marius. This is the best seen yet, Hugh Jackman is just perfection, the struggle within his being as Valjean is portrayed is amazingly emotional, realistic. He has to win best something for his performance. I am surprised that Russell Crowe can sing and did it it well. Costumes great. Good cast.<br/>May we never grow weary of films, arts, with a social conscious. The law is the law (Javert), But Justice with mercy (Valjean) brings life and grace.</p>

The bar and prostitute scenes though an important part of the story, went a little too far (in the typical Hollywood manner).  However that is my only complaint.  Russell Crowe, though his voice was not terrific,  made up for it with his acting.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[8]]<br/>I was riveted throughout the whole film, I found the characters enthralling. The big exception was Russell Crowe. The character of Javert should exude confidence and authority but I've never seen him look so stiff and lost in a film. At no point did he become Javert, he just looked like Russell Crowe being really uncomfortable.The poor portrayal of his character really made the story lose balance.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[9]]<br/>I loved this hauntingly captivating production and am going back tomorrow to see it again.  I bought the album online last night and strangely I even like Russell's songs, they seem for some reason to bring back the memory of those scenes more vividly than the more accomplished singing of the other cast members.  Probably an indication of how convincingly and sensitively he developed his Javert to gradually enmesh the viewer, something Russell seems to be able to do like no other actor I've seen.  Five stars except for the odd flat spot like that first innkeeper's scene.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[9]]<br/>Not a fan of musicals, all the more surprising that I enjoyed this film so much. Fantastic cinematography, very deserving of the hype. The richly detailed scenes and masterful symbolism held my interest for the duration of the film. Sacha B C tried a little too hard I felt and his accent went from British to french to Borat at times which was annoying. Russell Crowe a perfect choice for the role of serial bully Javert - probably not a particularly taxing role for him either. Ebony's singing a highlight and the older Cosette sang like the angel she portrayed.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[9]]<br/>The surprise for me was Samantha Barks' performance as Eponine. She stole the movie for me). Her scene when she sang On My Own while walking in the rain was just superb. I think because she was an unknown. I thought her performance was better than Anne Hathaway &amp;  as good as Hugh Jackman.  Eddie Redmayne was good as Marius although I could not believe that he was so besotted by Cosette  when he had such a striking Eponine beside him. Musical numbers were well staged however they missed some spectacle of past musicals like Oliver. Live singing  - genius...</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[9]]<br/>I guess there are 2 types of people in this world, those who love musicals and those who hate them.  If like me, you fall in to the first camp, I'm sure you'll love this adaptation. From the dramatic first scenes to the emotional climax I was sucked in to the world of Jean Valjean and 19th century France.  The cast are wonderful, including Russell Crowe.  We must not forget, that this is a film and not a stage production. Russell would not be cast in the West End to play Javert, but he's perfect for the roll on screen.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[1]]<br/>A half star for Crowe's bravery in agreeing to 'sing' opera.<br/>It must be judged lame when not one word on the screen was spoken in the hour I lasted. All-singing makes this an OPERA. <br/>Operas require singing of some standard. These are shameless amateurs, even at Jackman's level.<br/>And M. Schoenberg is still collecting income from such very ordinary music?<br/>On Broadway or in any other theatre, is it a musical? Or a movie? <br/>No... and here it's a very expensive opera, abysmally sung by self-conscious actors.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[2]]<br/>I will never understand the point of musicals where the music is so forgettable. And to make matters worse are the dreary sing/talking interludes between songs that are atrocious. Only one musical in my life time has ever been memorable and that is Jesus Christ Superstar. Excellent music and thought provoking lyrics.All Les Miserabale provoked was the thought of how miserable I was watching it. Russel Crowe was atrocious. And why is Anne Hathaway doing her songs with an Enlish accent? Perhaps she thought that was close enough to France? Lucky she didn't choose German or Spanish!</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[2]]<br/>Beautifully shot, I'm afraid even really good singers, which this film does not have, could not have saved it from the boring music. I have always thought the score was lacking in any really good music with it's totally unadventurous harmonic vocabulary and unmemorable melodies, it's unimaginative rhythms and forced climaxes. I usually like Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman, but casting them in this overblown piece of musical nonsense was a serious mistake. Almost embarrassing. Added to that, the length of the movie stretched out the tedium beyond measure.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[6]]<br/>Let me admit up front - I'm not a film musical fan (with the exception of Rocky Horror).  I love Hugh Jackman as a singer and thought he was great, and really enjoyed the comic relief of Sacha Baren-Cohen and Helena Bonham-Carter (she does crazy so well!!). Beautiful costumes and fantastic sets but I suffered through this one. The movie got a round of applause at our country cinema, and there were a lot of tears from the musical lovers but it left me dry-eyed. A love or hate film I think.</p>

Russell was unbearable, I actually felt bad for him! I found myself constantly checking my watch and considered walking out  after the first hour but stayed  in hopes that it might improve however it continued to drag on for another 2 hours! I found it amusing that people actually applauded at the end, I almost joined in, not for the fact that I enjoyed it but for the fact that it was finally over!</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[7]]<br/>Wonderful music and a great stage show not enhanced at all by this disappointing production. I had to grit my teeth every time Russell started to "sing". It was close to embarrassingly bad, why is David so kind?  Also, he failed for me to bring any of the necessary intensity to this man's naive trust in the law and finally to his inner torment.  Sacha Baron Cohen with his changing accents throughout, also failed to give any substance to this wonderful part for anyone who calls themself an actor.</p>

Great plot with sound performances by the big names but so slow: the director has been very self indulgent here and failed to produce anything worthwhile. The whole production, launched high by the hype and media attention, stalls early on and never recovers from its long flat spin back to Earth. Really disappointed given all the hype.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[1]]<br/>Tedious beyond what I can usually tolerate, it's an obviously unnecessary adaptation that doesn't modify what's already been done before. The momentum so frequently stalls because just about every sentence is sung - it is so hard to bear, seeing as the sentences don't rhyme most times. When I say tuneless, I mean it. It's truly unbearable and the only thing that could make it worse is the running time. At almost three hours of tuneless singing, this musical is 2012's apocalypse. I have no idea who could have seriously enjoyed this.</p>

It must of been worse for the actors involved. First hour was OK, but dragged on and on. A ridiculous amount of songs which after a while became a parody of itself- not all dialogue needed to be sung.  Hugh and Anne kept me watching. Eddie was awesome. Amanda/ Russ ordinary and some parts made me think I was watching Oliver!</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[8]]<br/>Hugh Jackman was the stand out performance for me. I can appreciate what Anne Hathaway was doing but with a musical you have to hear the tune of every song, its important.<br/>The upping of the grimness to the nth degree meant that the comedic relief no longer worked, its wasn't Cohen and Carter's fault, they did what they could.<br/>And saving the worst for last, I wouldn't have cared if Russell Crowe struggled to sing if he wasn't completely dead behind the eyes for the whole performance. He was clearly trying to act whereas Hugh Jackman inhabited his role.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[8]]<br/>I think seeing the musical in London originally sets an unattainable standard for singing and emotional connectivity.  At least I now realise this is set during the June uprising many years after the revolution. For people complaining it is long take a look at the book.

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[9]]<br/>Was overjoyed that the movie was so convincingly acted as to elicit real emotion in many scenes, just like the wonderful stage show. Admired the the bravery of having the actors sing live which mostly worked. Hugh J and Eddie Redmayne were standouts and Anne Hathaway was also impressive. Yes there were a few imperfections, but they were irrelevant to my involvement.</p>

What ever happened to the guy? He used to be terrific!  So sensitive! The Some of Us and Romper Stomper were great films! Now, he is vile!  Much like this flick!</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[10]]<br/>I cried from beginning to end. I performed in this musical way back in a Canberra 1994 production &amp; our cast  affectionately nicknamed "Les Mis" -  40 funerals &amp; a wedding! I thought Hugh was outstanding &amp; Anne Hathaway was wonderful too. Not an easy task to bring this iconic piece to film, but Tom Hooper succeeded. Enjoy it for what it is, a stage musical transferred to the big screen.  Cinematography was wonderful, &amp; I thought the chemistry between Hugh &amp; Russell was great. Flawlessly cast film.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[4]]<br/>Note to Hollywood - we don't all go to the cinema to see big-name stars. If you are casting what is really an opera (all singing, no talking) then find actors who can sing. Crowe ruined the all-important "suspension of disbelief' every time he opened his mouth - I felt myself move from the barricades in 1832 to a suffering 2013 music lover, hearing the wonderful songs tortured and butchered. <br/><br/>Very disappointing.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[9]]<br/>An terrific film of epic proportions. I was impressed by a strong ensemble cast with solid performances all round. Jackman's splendid performance managed to find the light and shade in what could have been a morose role. Anne Hathway managed the typical Victorian consumptive fade-away well but the part did little to support the strength she brought to the role. Crowe's Javert was handled well. Nuanced and multi-faceted and surprisingly sympathetic. Hooper's direction was creative. Huge extended close-ups and beautifully framed mid-shots were captivating on the big screen. The computer game-like quality of the CGI was, however, a little jarring.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[8]]<br/>Nice to see such a famous book, musical and story turned into a film, and overall, the film was a success. I would have preferred to see more intensity and inner conflict in the character of Javert.  Also, the Thernadiers could definitely have hammed it up a notch or two.  However, Hugh Jackman carried the role of Jean Valjean with expertise.  Eddie Redmayne was one of the nice surprises in the film too.  He brought something extra to the character of Marius, and I also found "Empty Chairs at Empty Tables" to be one of the moving highlights.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[3]]<br/>One star for costuming and another half for the last song which was quite good. I almost walked out after the first few minutes, but thought it may improve. It did marginally so I'm giving it 1.5 stars instead of absolute bomb status! <br/><br/>The computerised background and some of scenery I can only describe as absolutely amateurish, and the music was dreadful overall. It was about as interesting as watching the cricket! Poor Russell did his best but he's hardly a singer is he?<br/><br/>I'm sticking to the superb series with Depardieu which I'm watching at present on SBS!</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[4]]<br/>This movie lacks intensity throughout and, early on, I found myself wondering if I could stay the distance. Good acting and impressive sets can't make up for the weakness of Jackman's voice. What were they thinking in casting him in the first place? - it's a demanding musical, for heaven's sake - not an Oklahoma or Boy from Oz!  Such music deserves a better fate. Two stars for Anne Hathaway and Eddie Redmayne.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[8]]<br/>This took me on a strange, at times cringe-worthy journey.  Initially felt like walking out during the first 30 minutes with the "live" singing being uncomfortable to listen to.  Cringed every time Russell Crowe attempted to sing and he did it badly. Why was he cast? He certainly would not have been cast in any amateur stage production of Les Mis based on his voice. That aside, as the movie progressed it began to take me over.  It became very emotional at the end and I was won over.  Marius' song "Empty Chairs" was the highlight of the movie.</p>

It's the direction from Hooper that's the winner could've been a huge failure bringing possibly the best stage musical ever to film.

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[7]]<br/>For those who thought the film was long, apparently the original novel on which it is based is one of the longest ever written!  Even so I thought the movie had a terrific first half and strong in conclusion, but could have done with tightening elsewhere ( which perhaps is why some thought it dragged somewhat).  The central story between compassionate Jean Valjean and the ruthless Javert is superb and worth seeing.  Capably acted with  moments of brilliance, the only quibble I have is one of not sustaining tension throughout.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[9]]<br/>I was enormously impressed with the film and Tom Hooper has directed a superb cast and wonderful production team and has done enormous justice to the very rich and emotive storyline. One of the keys to the success of the film is the fact that all the singing was captured on set rather than miming to pre-recorded songs. This allowed the cast to deliver some very powerful and emotive songs that greatly enhanced the drama. Anne Hathaway's "I Dreamed a Dream" and Eddie Redmayne's "Empty Chairs at Empty Tables" were particular highlights. Highly Recommended.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[6]]<br/>This is a good film but not as good as everyone is saying. Hugh Jackman is really lame - I think that he has been to the Nicole Kidman School of Phoned in Performances. His singing was poor and he just had the frowny thing that he feels passes for acting going all the time. Russell Crowe sang flat the whole time but was still prefereable to Hugh. Hathaway is as good as everyone says. Amanda Seefreid is just plain awful (as she always is). The minor parts Fantine, the Thenandiers etc are all well taken. Good but not great.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[9]]<br/>This gem actually illustrates the power of cinema. The book by Victor Hugo tells you the story, depicts the characters and the emotions, describes the situation and the scenery. But there is no music, this powerful abstract vector of feelings... The musical on the other hand conveys all the emotions through notes and voices and the acting, but a stage is static, small and you sit far away from people's faces. <br/>The silver screen joins the two together, filling both the book and the musical gaps, displaying the grandeur of French Revolution, the sadness of Anne Hathaway, an unforgettable experience</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[6]]<br/>If you've seen a stage production of Les Mis, think carefully about spoiling your memory of that with this movie. The acting, sets and most of the singing are superb but Jackman's voice is not nearly good enough for the lead role and the last hour of the story should have been delivered in just half that time.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[8]]<br/>Good but patchy in ways that detracted from it being an outstanding movie.  Hugh Jackman got younger as the film  went by, where were Anne Hathaway's bloodied gums after giving up some teeth (when singing) and Russell Crowe's death lacked any emotional pull - I got no sense of the torment that led to his suicide. Also the music and sound were a bit soft in parts, especially in the 'do you hear the people sing' bits.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[4]]<br/>Really David. Apart from the affecting scene of Anne Hathaway singing the play's signature tune (then carking it), it was hard to not to wish that the main characters would speak rather than sing when they opened their mouths. Russell Crowe was all dark and tortured looks, and no amount of voice coaching could improve on the pub-band croaking well-suited to all those years fronting 29 Foot of Grunt. The kids redeemed the movie a smidge, although the heavy cockney accent of the little hero left us wondering how he got across to Paris before Eurostar. Watch Samsara instead.</p>

Jackman &amp; Hathaway's performances were outstanding.  I confidently expect him to get an Oscar, and she certainly deserves one too.  Russell Crowe turned in a solid Javert - he had just the right intimidating edge for the character &amp; did well enough with his songs. I am not a musical fan but I enjoyed this (much more than I expected to.) Runs a bit long for my taste, but it was worth it.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[9]]<br/>I was a slightly reluctant starter for this version of Les Miserable, having been a lover of the two productions of the stage musical that I have seen. I was soon won over however by the high production values, the 'live' singing and the excellent cast. I couldn't fault any of the actors in their roles. Looked at historically, the action in Hugo's novel took place years after the French Revolution, yet France was still in chaos in so many ways. How like today, when populations are struggling throughout the Middle East to make good their revolutions.</p>

What great ambassadors for Australia. And they pulled off the singing parts flawlessly. <br/></p>

Even Russell Crowe - hardly noted for singing got away with it well.<br/>People I saw it with thought Sacha Baran Cohen was the weak link - I disagree.

Russell Crowe is not a great singer lets face it but he did justice to the roll of Javert none the less.

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[10]]<br/>Loved it!  The singing was fantastic, I loved the raw quality of it - suited the pain of the setting well. Anne Hathaway moved the whole cinema to tears.  I thought Russell Crowe did well although he has been a bit criticised, I liked the way he sang and obviously Hugh Jackman was great.   The innkeepers came along at the right time with some light relief... we could all regroup from the crying!  The final scene left the audience uplifted and inspired.  Brilliant work again, Tom Hooper -can imagine this winning a lot of awards over the next few months.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[9]]<br/>I have seen several versions of filmed stage productions.<br/>The British original one had the best singing.<br/>However, this film had additional details in the story that were<br/>original and gave depth to the characters.  In particular, Javert walking on the edge of  a rooftop and finally jumping off, graphically cemented the compulsiveness of his personality.   He could not help himself, even though there was the unexpected softness when he pinned his medal on to the young dead revolutionary.<br/>Hugh Jackman is an amazing all-rounder---he seems able to do verything!   <br/>The script for the innkeeper/ wife, was protracted and the singing was disappointing.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[1]]<br/>this film should only be seen by those that have seen the musical or read the book - I have talked to people like this and they enjoyed it. However the rest of us found this movie very very tedious and boring, very very miserable.  Basically those who were totally unfamiliar with the story found it gut renchingly bad and I mean really really bad. It is three hours long and there is literally not one happy thing in it, it is afterall an opera and they don't call it les miserables for nothing. Give it a big miss.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[10]]<br/>My wife and I have seen the musical about half a dozen times, including several times in London with Colm Wilkinson and the original cast.<br/><br/>Whilst the singing in the film isn't a patch on the stage version, it adds additional layers of raw emotion and passion that's impossible to deliver when doing several performances a day.<br/><br/>Jackman and Hathaway are outstanding, Rusty isn't as bad as some made out, but is over-shadowed by Jackman. <br/><br/>If you like musicals, if -you believe Les Mis is the Prince of Musicals, then you will enjoy this immensely. An outstanding experience.</p>

Loved it and thought all the actors were fantastic.  I am American living in Australia and very proud of the Aussies!!!!<br/>My husband does not like musicals but went with me and also loved it!

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[6]]<br/>Enjoyable movie, but oh for the days when the actors could act as well as sing.    .   Some of the actors' singing was just okay, but even Hugh Jackman was a disappointment re singing.  But I was in the minority with that opinion, as some of the audience broke out in applause.....I can only add they mustn't go to the movies often.   The preceding pr with "blockbusters" often assures the attendance to the detriment of the less publicised films which can be exquisite.</p>

Agree that Russell Crowe's inability to sing was a minus - to some extent this spoiled Javert's death scene - but his acting was very strong.  It's a wonderful story of love, forgiveness and redemption!  Recommend it to all.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[8]]<br/>For lovers of dramatic musicals and Dickensian plots with strong moral overtones, this film is an undoubted feast with an outstanding performance by Hugh Jackman in a role made for him and truly worthy of an Academy Award; excellent performances by a feast of characters not forgetting of course our own Russell Crowe. However, one gets the feeling that by removing the singing parts and keeping the rest of the elements of this movie intact, a much shorter length drama would be as enjoyable! The production does drag in the middle but the ending is superb and emotionally satisfying.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[6]]<br/>Can't agree I'm afraid - a great opportunity lost. Kudos to Hugh and Anne (she was in particular a revelation!) who put their all into it, but were let down by the director's wallowing.  Hooper could have lost a good half hour to make it tighter. Carter and Cohen trotted out reprises of their roles in Sweeny Todd and Hugo (Sacha, what happened to your accent half way through?). Crowe tried, but achieved all the charisma of a fence post. Russell, where was the passion? The internal conflict? Still, some genuinely moving moments, especially Fantine's 'I dreamed a dream'.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[8]]<br/>I thought the acting, singing and sets were wonderful, but I feel a bit cheated because it was not on a big screen and there was no surround-sound. Consequently, the magnificence of the scenery was lost to some extent and the music did not fill the cinema as it should. <br/>Was this just the particular cinema we chose, or the way the film was made? <br/>Anyway, I thought Hugh Jackman was fantastic and Rusty wasn't bad either. The young actress who played little Colette... Courgette... um... Cosette (!) stole the show.</p>

As a first-timer to this story, I loved the struggle of Jean to be a better man through immense adversity and his attempt at an honest and humble life.<br/>The story development was engaging; I was drawn into the characters' lives and swept along with their emotions and passion, their lives and loves.

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[7]]<br/>Wonderful sets, very good acting, but an hour too long, too many boring songs, the plot was much to hard to follow with the singing, although this didn't much matter as the story line was old and predictable and was a minus to the movie.  To me, the mark of a great movie is whether I would go to see it again, but no way for this one.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[9]]<br/>I loved this movie.  &lt;Spoiler alerts!&gt; My shock in the first scene of realising they were singing live was the start of a magical film experience. Aside from "Oliver" etc, I've had no interest in musicals previously.  Crowe was the weakest singer but as David said, got by admirably. Hathaway was extraordinary - I have underestimated her.  It's hard to reconcile Jackman with his Wolverine roles - he was fantastic as the main character. At times this movie was sickening and dirty.  At others, beautiful and uplifting.</p>

The only dud note in an otherwise excellent film adaptation of the stage musical.  Anne Hathaway was out standing as Fantine, Hugh Jackman superb as always.  Samantha Barks was a fine Eponine, Eddi Redmayne &amp; Aaron Tveit also stood out.  I simply do not understand the casting of Russell Crowe.  His voice was not up to the requirements of the role &amp; to me this was a major casting error.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[7]]<br/>An uneven film that does some things better than the stage performance and others not so strongly. The cinematography is impressive and realistic - for example the gap created in Fantine's teeth where one has just been pulled out in exchange for money. The superbly acted singing, especially by Jackman and Hathaway is a big plus for the film, but it is not able to deliver the big musical moments with the same spine-tingling effect as can be achieved in the theatre. Crowe's Javert lacks real menace and threat, and Cohen is strangely unconvincing in the comic role.</p>

Ann Hathaway played her part well as did the cute little boy, Russell either needs singing lessons or a loud rock band as backing. Adorable Hugh sang some songs well but he didn't always look comfortable or happy doing it. A good production but without substance and so much song repetition that Les Mis aficionados would have adored, I know, I'm married to one. Party pooper me, maybe.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[8]]<br/>Great movie but it's hard not to compare it to the stage production which was far superior. I find it annoying that in musicals we still have to put up with actors where the roles should be filled with singers. While Hugh Jackman is good I thought he was too young for the role and as for Russell Crowe trying to sing - well. It would be hard for him as so many great singers have previously done the role of Javert. Surprisingly I thought Anne Hataway was good. The inn keeper scenes were sadly, too farcical. Still cried though.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[4]]<br/>I was bored stiff. It was about an hour too long, filled with passionless performances and terribly miscast. <br/><br/>Gone were the uplifting moments. It was a misery-fest. Victor Hugo's book had redeeming qualities that's turned it into such an enduring story.<br/><br/>The first quarter was well-done, with Anne Hathaway playing Fantine with all the passion I would expect from someone in her role. Amanda Seyfried was surprisingly lovely and had the standout voice in the film.<br/><br/>I didn't connect with any characters, and the director seemed to be fine with his cast SINGING about their feelings rather than actually SHOWING them.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[9]]<br/>My first ever Les Miserables experience is quite easily one of the best musicals I've ever seen. There are so many classic moments and stand-out performances. Let's begin with Anne Hathaway, what a breathtaking display of acting brilliance! Her rendition of 'I dreamed a dream' is mind-blowing! Eddie Redmayne, who lends such mature and terrific support along with his two love-interests, played by a surprisingly consistent Amanda Seyfried and an impressive debut from Samantha Barks. Rusty's vocal range is not as broad as that of his co-stars, but he does well and Hugh Jackman - Oscar please! This is masterful!</p>

What a fabulous performance. If you loved Les Miserables on stage, you won't be disappointed. Crowe is the only weak voice in the bunch, but as Javert he gets away with it (almost).</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[8]]<br/>I'm not really a fan of musicals, but this film is a winner.  The costumes, scenery, singing and music are all superb.  Sacha Baron Cohen is a real surprise; he was really great.  Anne Hathaway's rendition of "I dreamed a dream" was incredible.    Other than the fact I am still debating if our Russ can in fact sing, his acting cannot be faulted, and he was exceptional in his role. It is notable that there are probably less than 30 spoken words, if that in this 2 1/2 hour film, if you are wondering about the content level of music.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[9]]<br/>Crowe not a singer, what about his rock band TOFOG and others? Given the way the songs were recorded it is masterful. Love this version of Les Miserables having been twice in as many days with different groups. At times it reduced all to tears. Production values are very good, but I found it just a bit twee in the scene at the gate with Marius and Cosette ... could do without the fluttering butterflies when it is supposedly after dark.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[7]]<br/>Hugh Jackman is a revelation as Jean Valjean, the most victimised man in world literature.  Due to most of the dialogue being sung, this version is, more accurately, an opera rather than a conventional musical.  Going with non-singers was a good move by Hooper but some take away from the quality of the production - especially Crowe in the major role of Javert, but Jackman sings wonderfully well.  <br/>The sensationsl opening and closing scenes show Hooper's skill at handling big crowds.  All in all, uneven but great entertainment and a first for this type of Les Mis.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[10]]<br/>To me this was a film of epic themes, epic emotions and strring music. The cinematography, staging  were superb as was the acting and singing. I thought this was a brave film, with the director happy to have long close ups to allow a song to be fully realised. A mammoth film not propped up without many digital effects. And nice to see aussies centre stage I think Victor Hugo would have approved of the whole production.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[7]]<br/>I was  very disappointed. Hugh Jackman has a "nice" voice but he is no Colm Wilkinson. Russell Crowe was mis cast, his voice is very poor. Why could they have not got better singers for the 2 main male roles? There were better voices from the students then that of the actor playing Marius. I thought it was overdrawn, over long. Why did they have that elephant in so many shots?<br/>I LOVE the stage play of "Les Miserables" this did not live up to expectations.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[4]]<br/>This is a brilliant novel and stage musical. As a movie musical...it does not quite make it. The cinematography is sub standard. Sticking a hand held camera into the actors faces during many of the songs  distorts the faces of the actors. Russell Crowes voice is not up to the damands of the role of Javert. His "thing" is grunting in front of ordinary rock bands. I would like to know why Hugh Jackmans (Jean Valjeans) voice is different in every song he sings. (Wierd !!) Basically this is a heroic attempt to pull off ...the impossible. It fails.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[6]]<br/>This movie was an assault on the ears. The sound track is thunderous, loud, and never lets up. The acting (other than the incompetent Amanda Seyfried) was impressive and the production design was impeccable. It was too bombastic and featured too many close-ups, but it was still a dramatic and fairly engaging epic. 3/5</p>

Performances are all stellar with a breakthrough from Hathaway, she is sublime and her "I dreamed a dream" pulls every heart string. This is a thoroughly entertaining and moving musical that everybody should give a chance.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[8]]<br/>Nicely done, although I felt the stage show had a bit more oomph. The main thing for me was that some of the singing was not so strong.  It worked best when the characters were both seasoned actors and singers, like Hugh Jackman.  Russell Crowe, for example, had a weak voice and barely changed his expression throughout the film.  Still, it is hard to view it objectively, as I was a devotee of the stage show.  However, a friend saw it with me (who had no prior exposure to anything Les Mis) and she was totally engaged and moved throughout.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[10]]<br/>When was the last time that, at the close of a film, there was spontaneous applause? This presentation got that and it was well deserved. Most would have read of Jackman's stand-out performance. As the film flows, he just gets better and better. Okay, Crowe doesn't have Quast's lower registers but he does a more than reasonable job with the voice he has and that, complemented by his acting ability, makes a good Javert. As for the supporting cast - they don't let anyone down.<br/><br/>Watch for the Jean Valjean - nice to see his inclusion in this film.</p>

<p class="comment">((Les Miserables))[[7]]<br/>I thought  this adaptation of the stage musical started rather slowly, more slowly than the stage musical version I saw in the late '80s I think, however it did build up to a stirring crescendo. Hugh Jackman was very good as was the actor who played Marius whom I had seen earlier in the year in "My Week With Marilyn". I especially liked the child actor who played the boy with the Cockney accent who was shot fronting the barricades.</p>

Yee Gods he's an awful singer.  Anne Hathaway stunning, Hugh great but well below his best due to the high notes asked for. Samantha Barks as Eponine is awesome and her voice from the angels.<br/><br/>The extra lyrics are trite, poorly written and totally out of place.  All in all, a massive disappointment.
