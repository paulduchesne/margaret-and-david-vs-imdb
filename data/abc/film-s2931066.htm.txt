<h2>Inception</h2>
<p><em>Review by David Stratton</em></p>
<p>Cobb, LEONARDO DI CAPRIO, is, by his own claim, the world's most skilled extractor. This means he is able to steal ideas and secrets from the minds of his targets by entering their dreams. He gets paid large sums of money for this, though he's increasingly haunted by the memory of his dead wife, Marion Cotillard, who literally infiltrates the dream scapes. Cobb is hired by wealthy Japanese businessman Saito, KEN WATANABE.<br/><br/>Saito wants Cobb to plant an idea in the brain of Robert Fischer Jr., CILLIAN MURPHY, the heir to a rival business empire; for this 'inception', Cobb assembles a team that includes his regular assistant Arthur, JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT; Eames, a British shape-shifter, TOM HARDY; scientist Yusuf, DILEEP RAO; and a brilliant young woman recommended by his father-in-law, MICHAEL CAINE - she's Ariadne, ELLEN PAGE.<br/><br/>At first viewing, Christopher Nolan's dazzlingly complex INCEPTION is not easy to comprehend fully - I think that it's one of those films, like BLADE RUNNER or 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY, that will repay many viewings in order to grasp all the intricate details of these multi-layered trips into the dreams and nightmares of the central characters. At a time when the vast majority of Hollywood films have no ideas whatsoever, it's quite inspiring to receive a film over-burdened with ideas, and visual excitement, almost to the point of sensory overload. <br/><br/>Driven by a gallery of charismatic performances, Wally Pfister's superb cinematography, Hans Zimmer's powerful music score and some amazing CGI effects, including the streets of Paris rising up and folding in on themselves, this is a truly unforgettable movie experience. The climax, in which several dreams, and story-lines, are intercut to dazzling effect, is particularly memorable. There's a quirky sense of humour, too, in the employment of the Edith Piaf song, "Non, Je regrette rien" as an important plot point - it was the song Marion Cotillard sang in her breakthrough Piaf bio-pic. INCEPTION is a film I'll want to see again and, probably again; but on first viewing, its initial impact is mind-boggling.</p>
<h2>Further comments</h2>
<p>DAVID: Margaret?<br/><br/>MARGARET: Isn't it amazing, we're all talking about it days afterwards. <br/><br/>DAVID: I think everybody will be talking about this film.<br/><br/>MARGARET: , "If that's that, could that be that?"<br/><br/>DAVID: Yes.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Look, honestly, it's so interesting conceptually.<br/><br/>DAVID: Mm.<br/><br/>MARGARET: He's such a good filmmaker. It's the best performance Di Caprio has given in ages and, ultimately, what I loved about the film is, despite all the action and the CGI, it has compassion at its heart. <br/><br/>DAVID: Yes.<br/><br/>MARGARET: It's really beautiful, whichever way you interpret the ending. <br/><br/>DAVID: Well, there are so many interpretations.<br/><br/>MARGARET: It's compassionate, on any level, and I love it. I think - he spent 10 years working on the screenplay for this and obviously, you do want to see it again to - like MEMENTO, although I think this leaves MEMENTO for dead, and I've got to tell you the other mind-bending film that DiCaprio was in, SHUTTER ISLAND, INCEPTION leaves that film for dead. It's just streets ahead of anything I've seen in a long time. <br/><br/>DAVID: I think we're talking about an instant classic, actually...<br/><br/>MARGARET: Yes.<br/><br/>DAVID: ...which people will be talking about years to come.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Yes.<br/><br/>DAVID: What are you giving it?<br/><br/>MARGARET: Well, I'm giving it four and a half and I wonder why I'm not giving it five, but I'm giving it four and a half.<br/><br/>DAVID: Well, I'm giving it four and a half too.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br>I have just watched Interstellar and there is no point of comparison.  Inception grows bigger and bigger with repeated viewings.  Interstellar dwarfs in comparison.  Same director, and such disparity.  Let's hope Nolan can quickly recover and go back to the level of Inception and Memento, another modern masterpiece.  What a movie.  What and experience.  I will continue watching it and watching it again and again.  A true modern masterpiece.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br>It seems like a century between this movie and Dark Knight Rises.  If you are just seeing Nolan films for the first time, know this:  THIS film is his Citizen Kane.  It's the best he's probably ever going to be.  And it acts like an IQ test:  the smarter you are, the more this film makes sense to you. Characters flat?  Maybe. But, in the main, you WILL feel the pain of Cobb, the main character.  All in all, I don't care who you are, you will LOVE this film or you are made of wood.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[4]]<br>As expected, I found the story complex but the film had big plaudits so I was ready to make the effort. But I soon noticed that whole lines of dialogue by almost every single player were  being delivered without passion. They had been given no direction on how to speak and often seemed to be reading in a fast monotone.  DiCaprio should study say, Mel Gibson's body of work to see how that NIDA graduate has acted in his films, using facial expression, vocal inflection, and body. As I found the acting wooden, ultimately I didn't care about the characters.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br>This is an incredible film - all at once entertaining, intellectual, spellbinding, suggestive, thematic, challenging - I could go on.  It works both as an action film and as a piece of art.  The music too is brilliant.  Watching the film is like being in a dream.  <br>Inception explores the nature of reality in a way that challenges the viewer.  This is one those films you need to see a number of times to pick up on everything that is going on.  If you haven't already seen it - go see it now!</br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br>An absolutely amazing film! One of if not the best film I have ever seen, anyone who (amazingly) hasn't seen this film, definitely should, it has only been given low ratings by people who are't intellectual enough to comprehend the story line.<br><br>At first viewing it is beyond amazing, but the beauty of this movie is that afterwards, you will keep thinking about it, again and again, and no doubt you always come back to watching again.<br><br>This movie nails it on all fronts, action, suspense, drama, comedy, adventure, thriller. Again in one word AMAZING.</br></br></br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[3]]<br>I just watched this movie, believing the hype, in hope of a going on a surreal, psychological adventure. Unfortunately I found it dull and one dimensional. I didn't find it at all complex, rather just incredibly lazy and obvious; a dream within a dream...or was it a dream.. who knows... whoa!<br><br>The idea of lucid dreaming and psychology is an interesting concept, but ultimately it's not explored with any great depth, in the end I found this to be a run of the mill Hollywood action movie with a couple of cool creative CGI scenes.<br/></br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[9]]<br>Bloody loved this film to bits, it just comibined things like; action, mind mess ups and just pure awesomeness. I think this is one of the best films I've ever seen and now I've seen about 10 times. It just leaves you questioning and guessing days to come after you watch it. Great acting and a great cast just makes it even better.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br>Shows what truly happens when you get stuck in someone else's dreams, scary. But Nolan had the last laugh, ultimately ripping off previous ideas that have been done before in many movies and tv, and mish-mashing them all into one movie, therefore claiming himself to be an original genious. Although was very slick and entertaining. And still worth viewing over and over. First class performances from the whole cast. But it has all been done before, eg: The Matrix, an episode of Futurama(The Sting), a Thai movie called:Loveaholic. Nolan's ultimate inception, is that Inception is his original idea.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[2]]<br>I really hated this movie. I fell asleep. I didnt understand it, try to, or even care that I didn't get it. I don't know what the fuss was about. Dream within a dream? Six levels of a dream? People tied together with rope flying through the air in someone's dream? I just thought it was really overrated, way too long and disappointing! In short, a w*nk.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[9]]<br>This is by far one of the best films of all time. For Hollywood to finance a film like this just reinvigorates my love of films and shows that there may be more thoughtful and buetifully made films in the future. Christopher nolan is a master and this is a piece of art. However margret said in the review that it used lots of CGI, however Nolan has said that most of the sciences, like the spinning hotel scene, are done with mowings sets and stuntmen.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[7]]<br>Another imaginative and well-conceived film by Nolan. But it did leave me a bit disappointed.<br><br>The lack of characterisation and the constant pace can be explained away by saying that it's all meant to feel disjointed and dreamlike but the end result is that I just care less.<br><br>And a film that speeds through it's expositions so fast is pretty much admitting that it doesn't want the audience to think about the silliness of some of the 'rules of the game'. How you get a bunch of people sedated and into a common dream when you're already dreaming, for example.</br></br></br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br>As a movie lover in his late 40's with probably 500 movies under my belt over the years all I can say is Wow! This is an instant classic, up there with the best. If you are prepared to clear your mind of any pre conceptions and alow the director to take you into the carefully formed  characters  then you will step into a world where dreams become reality and the storyline is pure genuis. If not  then you will be disapointed like some of the others who have reviewed this movie on this forum. A masterpiece</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[5]]<br>I was ready to put my 'inception cap' on and really delve inside some awesome mind-bending psychology..but no. <br> Nolan is afraid to plant the seed of an idea and let the audience grapple with it. The Characters explain absolutely everything for typical spoon-fed yank audience. Nothing is left for you to figure out...like one of the commenters below me said  "They even needed to write it on a white board so we could remember"     ....and can i watch a realistic sniper scene for once...please!!</br></br></p>

They just had to plant idea so he would change his mind and that was it, the whole movie. I guess the dreaming bit was little confusing but the movie is overrated.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[9]]<br>Fantastic!  I was enthralled from start to finish.  I agree with M &amp; D that it is a movie you do need to see more than once.  Such complexity.  And Blair - I agree with you.  How often does one get to see such a wonderfully challenging bit of cinema.  I admit I got 'lost' more than once but further viewing would clear any confusion I'm sure.  A real movie experience. Adored it!!</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br>Beyond compare.  3 dimensional weavings.  Conceptual work of art that will remain a classic for those able to grasp abstract constructs.  Stacked imagery - illusions referenced directly to the work of artists (eg: Escher - incomplete staircases etc).  Complex,  intellectual.  Piaf reference witty.  The poignancy of the wife subplot is brilliantly muddied as it creeps slowly towards horror -  more subtle dread than was once engendered by the dream-locked Freddy Krueger.  Brilliantly relentless in placing its protagonists in grip of tense deadlines.  Dreams are your mind collating references.  The  visual references to art  in creating illusions here is thrilling.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br>I've just read the comments by some who claim to not understand this film and suddenly I understand why Hollywood generally makes generic easy to understand drivel - it's all the mass audience is capable of understanding. I can imagine the same people that hated this coming out of a Chuck Norris festival saying "Oh, wow, man, that was awesome!"<br>Thank god for Christopher Nolan and the fact there is at least one original, intelligent filmmaker coming out of Hollywood today.<br>This is one of THE BEST movies I have ever seen</br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[0]]<br>My husband and I watched the first twenty minutes or so of this movie and just gave up. The script was awful; they obviously felt the need to explain everything to the viewer and DiCaprio's acting was dreadful! And no, the concept was not too difficult to understand and it did not go over our heads. It was plain boring and only a new and wonderful idea if you never really think about reality, dreams, consciousness and so on. Truly appalled that everyone loved this dumbed-down garbage.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br>I loved it. Only seen it once (at the cinema), but I'll be getting it out on DVD/Blu-ray &amp; probably, buy it at some stage.  There's more than enough to have you enthralled 1st time around, but you have to watch it again to grasp more of an understanding. Some people get frustrated at complex stories, but I think this is accessable at so many different levels as to have broad appeal. You can have a different journey in every viewing.  I like to write so I've focused on story, but the direction, fx and performances are top notch too.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br>I loved the movie and I have seen it twice. It's one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time, filled with great ideas Hollywood lacks. It keeps you on the edge, makes you think and tests your intelligence. Leonardo plays Codd very well and it is a brilliant performance but I may be biased as he is one of my favourite actors. He is amazingly talented and so is Marion  - I still remember her in her role of Edit Piaf. <br>Great movie and I wish there were more of them.</br></br></p>

First it was so dark I had trouble seeing what was going on.   Then the dreams on dreams sequences made me quite dizzy, confused and sick.   I tried hard to concentrate and get into it, but after a while I just had to give it away as a bad job, even after so many had raved about it.   It now lies in my 'dream world junk yard' along with " The Sound of Music "</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/>Visually and Emotionally Stimulating. I am simply lost for words. A fantastic original (non 3D) heist film. Christopher Nolan has proved that he is a true visionary who will one day join the likes of Kubrick and Scorsese (If the Academy don't snub him again mind you). Fantastic Special effects and deafening score from Hans Zimmer and an amazing narrative that is paced excellently. An incredibly talented cast with fantastic performances across the board. Inception is one of those films that will be talked about for decades to come. Maybe eve become a 2001 or blade runner.</p>

They build a giant hallway and actually turned it round and round.<br/>2. Christopher Nolan built a Life size hospital in the mountains and then blew it up.<br/>3. for anywhere that there was a change in gravity, e.g. the restaurant, they built it and actually moved it around.<br/>but i do agree with Doc on this one in the sense that they should have gone more deep into the character of Eames and Arthur.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[5]]<br/>In the first few seconds we see a pistol and a machine gun. A sign of what to expect for the next 3 hours? Sadly, yes. <br/><br/>The idea of shooting people's "projections" in their dreams is lame, and clearly just a way of "video-gaming" this story into an action flick. <br/><br/>Some good dreaming ideas destroyed by popcorn thrills, chases, explosions and guns. It's amazing that some people say it's an "intelligent" film. Come on! Try counting how many people get blown away in pointless gun battles. <br/><br/>Interesting concepts, and a visual treat, but cheap, lacking soul, missed potential. <br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[9]]<br/>This is easily the best movie of 2010. If you like movies based around ideas and Chuang-tzus notion of the dream within a dream then go and see this movie. <br/><br/>However, if you like predictable and vacuous Hollywood action films or puerile romantic comedies, then don't bother. If you find it hard to concentrate or think critically about a movie then ths is not the movie for you.  <br/><br/>It is refreshing to see movies like this that deviate from the standard repertoire and actually stimulate you to think. Excellent movie, highly recommended.</p>

I don't think it was that interesting at all - fairly one dimensional in fact.  There was no character development and basically no plot just a tricky concept some people find "cool".<br/>I think the general public have well and truly dumbed down if they think this is so great.<br/>Leo was good though - the one star is for him.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/>I haven't seen a movie so intense since Apocalypse Now, which cannot compare to Inception.  The special effects were fantastic and the ending kept you hanging and still wondering what is really real?  I watched it twice, I may watch it a few more times and like a good book,  I may learn more.  Absolutely loved it, especially after just watching George Clooney's new movie the night before which had NO PLOT at all.  It was entertaining on every level.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/>I have just watched this excellent film for the second time with my son.  I am already looking forward to the third time, and the fourth, and the fifth, and so on.  This incredible, mind blowing, intelligent film does truly belong with 2001 Space Odyssey, Blade Runner, and so many others of similar nature.  There should be more films like this, and, for once, well done Hollywood.  As for the concept of ideas being implanted in peoples' minds, isn't that what the media and politicians do on a daily basis?  Terrific film.  Best of 2010.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[9]]<br/>One of the best movies in a long time, though not without some flaws. Level 3 (the snow fortress) wasn't as thrilling or absorbing as the falling van or the zero g hotel (but the climax of the final Kick redeemed it). And I kept expecting there to be labyrinths, but none appeared - no physical ones at least. But the real story, the cause of Cobb's guilt, was powerful. Perhaps those below who left half way through would have changed their minds about disliking it if they had stayed to see what he had (inadvertently) done.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[7]]<br/>Anyone that knows anything can agree that the persons initial attitude would be fearful. Seeing me as a dream itself, they are afraid of the confidence i exude. Unable to comprehend the notion that we are in fact talking to one another, they become afraid. The difference is in the detail, details that are unavoidably accurate.<br/><br/>Hint: When your in a dream, find the lightswitch, then turn it on.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[9]]<br/>Like David says, an "instant classic" that has so much heart.  Despite the technology, the cleverness, Inception works because of the humanity of the performances, the pitch perfect score and the emotional pull of that desire to go home...wonderful. Let's hope Oscar thinks so!</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[8]]<br/>Needs a second viewing.  Watched it on DVD in less than ideal circumstances.  Nevertheless, hugely impressed.  <br/>The "main" story of planting the idea into Fischer's mind, with all the Bond-style background, would have made a satisfying blockbuster on its own, but nothing special.  But the slowly revealed backstory of the wife who lost grip on reality, elevated the film.  Next time I see this, that's the "main" story for me... to see if she wasn't right all along and Leo is still lost dreaming about being a superspy being chased around the world by corporate types.</p>

Love all of it-took two watches for me to comprehend it in its entirety- but it is a beautiful film: it definitely followed in the vein of The Matrix. Loved the soundtrack, absolutely epic. Actors were good, CGI and action well put. And at the end it leaves you wondering-what is real? And are we living in the greatest dream of all? <br/>"You're waiting for a train..."</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[5]]<br/>The 18 year old boy in me loved it. Having said that, I found it extremely trite and confusing. Is it just me, or has it become a competition in Hollywood to make the most confusing movie possible and hope people are too afraid to admit they just "don't get it"?....well guess what ? For 90% of this film, I had no idea what was going on. Thing is, the action was enjoyable enough. A bit like watching someone else play a really good PC game but not nearly as involving.</p>

While there are several comparrisions to be made between the two, they are ultimately very different films.<br/>The loud gasp from the audience at the end of the film was a good indication of the level of suspense and engagement with the story.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[8]]<br/>This is a great fun roller coaster ride of a movie.  The cast is great, the acting is good and the ideas have been fantastically brought to life on the big screen.  But having said all that, it wasn't a completely satisfying experience.  The story was lacking some depth, and I never managed to get rid of the distinct feeling that I was watching a hollywood film -  a negative for me.  Also, Watanabe's accent, at times, was impenetrable.</p>

The movie leaves your mind filled with knowledge after it's over.<br/><br/>Confusing, at first, but after the movie, I added the pieces together. But's a visual masterpiece, and it was INCREDIBLE! One of the greatest films I've ever seen. Great music score created by Hans Zimmer, and a terrific cast by ever member.

I was engaged every second (of the 3 times I have already seen this film already.)<br/>As mentioned by David, the film music score by Hans Zimmer is very powerful and matches the mood of the film beautifully. Great acting by DiCaprio, Ellen page, CIllian Murphy etc. <br/>My only negative point is Five stars is not enough. <br/>Cheers.</p>

I said "shhh, this is awesome". Maybe its a movie for guys who loved matrix 3, but in any case its one of the best movies I've ever seen...</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[7]]<br/>Just saw Inception with my husband and son.  Son loved it and husband and I were somewhat entertained.  I agree it is full of interesting concepts about layers of consciousness but this becomes an end rather than a means for a bit more depth...Cotillard totally miscast, and the "genius" of the troupe much too pat and formulaic.  It is definitely a cut above the usual hollywood movie but no heart!  Why are we meant to care about someone who steals for a living?  Is he the moral hero?  Bring back bogie I say!</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[8]]<br/>Finally watched this, and my oh my, one of those films that made me gasp a few times with each reveal. I loved it. I love the vision that Chris Nolan had for this, and the whole way through I just thought, what a bloody brilliant idea. LOVE the dream within a dream within a dream. Terrific performances, but yet all understatedly so. Shame the trailer gave away every awe-inducing visual scene. None left to savour during the movie. Thought the music just added to the drama and urgency of it all. My mind is blown.</p>

By the end, I was overloaded with a sense that I have just sat through two and a half hours of utter drivel, a supposedly 'intelligent movie' made with the sole intention of confusing the hell out of the audience for absolutely no purpose. <br/><br/>A pointless waste of time.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[7]]<br/>((Inception))[[7]]<br/>Great concept, one of the great achievements in sound on film, wonderful cinematograpghy, uniformally good performances, but yet only three and a half stars. A combination of The Matrix and even James Bond provides many thrills and spills. The problem is that one doesn't really care for the characters and the film is way too long. But, I will see it again and maybe the rating will change. Also, I must point out to Krystal that 2001 is also my favourite movie but David was not comparing this film with that; just that you need repeat viewings.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[9]]<br/>Its a pain that The Matrix covered so much ground because it's really hard to explore the genre with-ought ending with similarities in the narrative and special effects of both movies. Inception was a genuinely heartfelt action film that did push boundaries and was complemented by some fantastic acting. Just enjoy it.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/>Absolutely brilliant. I unfortunatly did research on this film before I saw it; and so I didn't expect I enjoyed it as much as I should've but, wow... what a amazing, original movie. Chris Nolan is my favourite because unlike other directors, who spoon feed their auidence with boring unlikeable cinema, Nolan makes you think! Inception made me think and gave me an full cinematic experience, something you can sink your teeth into and think about. The acting and script is great, the CGI is really amazing stuff. This is my new favourite film!!! A movie that makes you think!!!</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/>The closest thing to the mind-blowing sensory impact of Inception is the first Matrix. But that's where any comparisons end, because Inception is SO unique. <br/><br/>Seeing this movie is the next best thing to dreaming about it tonight. I couldn't fault it, except that it's 10 seconds too short!!! (The suspense was interminable.)<br/><br/>Watch Inception with someone important in your life, and see it on the bigscreen. But if you liked Mama Mia, don't watch this film! You'll be really, really disappointed.</p>

From the opening we copped a tirade of explosions, people getting shot incessantly, to ultimate  boredom  and generally   being belted around the  ears  from this incessant ruckus .  I almost walked out afte the first ten minutes. indeed. I did make temporary exit half way!   I shall probably pay this movie another visit to try and try to see what I may have missed.  1.1/2 stars - Thank hevens for 'Me and Orson Welles' -  *****</p>

It lacked characters that one could warm to. It was too long. It failed to get me to want to see it to the end.

I felt a little like I did when I saw Avatar - it looked amazing, but there was something missing that prevented it from being a Star Wars or Raiders experience. A little too clever at times, but you can't blame them for trying. And I can only imagine that those giving this movie bad scores either didn't understand it or have short attention spans because it's certainly a great viewing experience at the very least.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/>As a musician,I have been a mess since I saw this movie, yet the HZ theme for Time, is only 5 chords. What is so significant is that  this time the production works backwards through the soundtrack to invoke the sum total of Nolan's scripting genius. This film is so relentless and powerful on so many levels and way beyond pure entertainment. I believe it will remain a modern cultural icon and in the least, it is the most powerful, honest and eloquent reflection of the time we live in. This film has the Power of Transformation.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[6]]<br/>I expected much more. What's with comparing it to 2001? (My favourite movie.) It didn't really make me think, it didn't blow my mind as everyone had said and it really wasn't that exciting. I did enjoy it, and I'll definitely watch it again, I just don't see what all the fuss is about. In fact, I think that's the problem - the fuss. Perhaps all the hype ruined it for me. The acting was fine - Tom Hardy was fantastic - and it looked great, but overall it was just a better than average movie.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/>Intersting point is how his wife entrusted him with their lives... then when she asks for the same trust he won't follow her... they have different ideas about what is the real "real" world. I believe this movie is about trusting someone you love so much that you will follow them anywhere... even to death.. <br/><br/>I remeber something like "There is a train coming, I don't know where it will take us, but it doesn't matter... when I wake up I know that you will be there!"<br/><br/>Amazing movie in every aspect!</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[4]]<br/>A great concept that runs through the various themes of the movie - but it  was destroyed by a constant wall of noise and action.  An hour later and I am aware that I have temporary damage to my hearing that will add up in a small way to all the other hearing insult that I have suffered at the movies.  The whole movie was just one huge over-stimulus.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[9]]<br/>I have no problem with people not 'liking' the movie, but the ignorance in many of these comments is quite profound. If you think that Inception was ''silly and predictable', then I am afraid that if film watching was graded you would be receiving a massive EF for EPIC FAIL. This is simply one of the more complex mainstream films ever made.<br/><br/>The ending was wholly interpretative, i.e. each viewer can choose their 'reality', just like Cobb. If you think the ending was 'simple', it is merely a reflection of your own thought pattern Im afraid.<br/><br/>A finely spun masterpiece.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[6]]<br/>I really wasn't all that impressed. I wasn't thinking about it days later - or even the next day. And yet this genre is one of my favs. I wasn't convinced by the internal logic and it just looked like an action flick to me in the end. I think Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, while very different in many ways, played with this territory in a manner that was more innovative. And the first Matrix gave me a bigger thrill</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[8]]<br/>I was at a party once and there were a bunch of arthouse film snobs talking about current movies in the backyard. After an earnest discussion on Jean Baudrillard and soviet cinema that lasted half an hour, a  bogan who was also at the part wandered up and said; <br/><br/>"You know what movie I watched? Out of Sight. That movie really made you think." <br/><br/>After a few seconds of dead silence, the bogan swore at the group and left the party. <br/><br/>I'm not quite sure what I'm trying to say except; see Inception: It really makes you think.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[4]]<br/>I was really underwhelmed by this film. It just seemed to be a big mess with no character development and no wit or humour in the script. Nolan did much better on a fraction of the budget with Momento. Why do directors who get big budgets spend the money on car chases instead of excellent scripts??? So tired of mediocre, uninventive, unsophisticated Hollywood films!</p>

I didn't find it all that thought-provoking, and was only toward the end that I really cared about the characters. Visually excellent, even if a tad too 'real' looking in parts to be within a dream- or several of them. Also, I think 'Exposition'  may be a more accurate title...</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[1]]<br/>Stories can be told in such a way that the viewer can "join the dots" and work it out for him or herself, not so here.<br/><br/> Every single scene in this film has a ridiculous ongoing narrative, explaining what the characters are supposed to be doing next, to the point that I was simply yearning for the "new wave" of British directors of the early 70's again.<br/><br/>No subtlety is evident in this film, which is largely a "cut and paste" of other, far more original idea's.

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[9]]<br/>I think what works about this film is that Nolan gets this great balance. It's complicated but it's not too complicated, there's action but not too much action, enough humour to know you're supposed to have fun. The result is a standout in mainstream cinema. The funny thing about some of these reviews is you can't tell whether the people who don't like it, dislike it because they think they're smarter than the people-who-like-it-because-they-think-they're-smarter-than-the people-who-don't-like-it, or just genuinely dislike the movie. It's like Inception, but with levels of pretentiousness.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[5]]<br/>I was expecting a lot and was rather disappointed. The script was dull in many places with it not being that complex at all. There were "rules" of the dreamscape that were explained heavily and then completely ignored during the climactic scene! I did like the effects, cinematography and score, but I honestly can not see why this is getting such rave reviews. During the film I was thinking all of these faceless gunmen were just like Storm Troopers from Star wars who couldn't hit the side of a barn!<br/><br/>Go and rent Moon instead.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[5]]<br/>I liked momento. I didn't like the prestige. I didn't like this so much. Reasonable idea.<br/><br/>I think those that are doing cartwheel over this film have allowed the computer FX to obscure what was a pretty bland script.<br/><br/>Why do writers have characters that say "let me ask you something" instead of just asking the question that is on their mind?<br/><br/>Well before the end I didn't care what was a dream and what wasn't. Was I having a dream? I just wanted it wrapped up so I could go home, or have the music start to wake me up.<br/><br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[9]]<br/>I usually like films that other people love or hate, although this time I suspect "dont get" is more likely than hate. But really, whats not to get. The story is complex and the premise is completely original and the production near flawless. I may finally have a reason to use the Blueray player becuase I intend to watch it again.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[4]]<br/>Not too complicated, interesting premise, could have made a fascinating psychological exploration.  But, the second half deteriorated into a computer game, complete with 'levels' and detached gun violence.  Did this movie have two directors?  One, exploring the mind, and the other keeping a generation of computer gamers happy????  A waste of some extraordinary talent in the end.  A shame.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[2]]<br/>A more suitable title would be "The Deception"! An underwhelming, empty script and cast of characters which Hans Zimmer attempts to bolster with his overbearing, intrusive soundtrack. Perhaps some of us  have been deceived by the clumsy attempt at profundity.</p>

Tom Stoppard knew how to do a play within a play and Matrix did an ok job of putting Plato's writings about perception and reality on the screen. But this film is just silly and predictable. How many climaxes can one reallly have? Maybe I just dont have multiple orgasms. As my friend said. Its just another video game put out as a movie.</p>

Instead there is a massive plot hole in the end how it doesn't explain A) how going a level deeper got them into limbo, and B) how he got from limbo down to the stage where the Asian guy was old. I would have rather it been longer and covered more.</p>

But that did nothing to distract from the satisfaction and sheer delight of seeing it played out. Like expecting the exact flavour of a desert when you first read about it in the menu, long before ordering your entree, but still finding it even better than perfect when it comes. Bravo.

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[8]]<br/>I really enjoyed this film.  It was engaging, fun and very clever.   <br/><br/>My one disappointment was that I went into the film expecting it to be more confusing and difficult to follow.  I found that I was following the film really well but I kept expecting a big twist that would confuse me but it never occurred.

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[9]]<br/>My wife and I saw this film last night and have been talking constantly about it for the last 15 hours, trying to piece together all the threads. As far as science fiction films are concerned, this is (as David asserted), an instant classic and beats the clumsily-written Avatar to a pulp. We need more films that both entertain us and make us think concurrently and this film has certainly lived up to expectations.<br/><br/>If quality science fiction cinema to you is on par with Spaceballs, then save yourself the trauma and give it a miss.<br/><br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[8]]<br/>I love the concept of being a master creator of your own world, which we all in escense are. I wasn't so sure aabout using the same style as in Dicaprio's second latest film, Shutter Island, though. Bit much. Something more stylized to fit the subject matter would have made me feel less like I was watching one in a series of 'Dicaprio-style' films.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[1]]<br/>For once I do not agree with David and Margaret. This movie contains nothing new in concept and I would have thought that David and Margaret would have recognized the recycled ideas of the 13th Floor, Total Recall, Dark City and The Matrix. Nothing New here but a waste of my time and money. See it if you have not seen any of the above mentioned movies. Leonardo Decaffichino is terrible. Definitely not a classic and totally predictable. Somebody please wake me up from this bad dream otherwise I want my money back.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[4]]<br/>Two stars from me for the ideas and concepts, however CGI overload spoilt the film. The prolonged action sequences detracted from the individual characters' performances so much that I am unable to say I was particularly impressed by any of them. Too long - it could have been reduced by at least 30mins. David and Margaret seem to have been desensitized to the overuse of CGI - I wish they had indicated that so much was in the film when they reviewed it. Avatar suffered from much the same thing.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[3]]<br/>Too much.<br/><br/>No subtlety.<br/><br/>Obvious, predictable and pretentious. Characters were cardboard cut-outs. Main plot device (getting Fischer to break up the company) was uninteresting and not worthy of the over importance placed on it by the film. Multiple dreams in dreams != complex stroyline.<br/><br/>When Cobb says "He'll go into Limbo, a world of pure subconscious" I couldn't help laughing, that was the line of too much for me.<br/><br/>although, the idea of the Totem is very clever.</p>

Whether you liked it or not (how could you not like it), people are talking about how they interprete the end. I feel sorry for those that walked out.

Good on the studio for taking a chance on it and not try to dumb it down.  The score was amazing and the end scenes were very moving.  I was not a big fan of Leonardo but I enyoyed his performance in this.  I am surprised by the number of people who walked out!</p>

Very extreme.<br/><br/>It wasn't the best film i've ever seen but I think it was very interesting conceptionally, though I personally prefer heist films and 'mind' films. The acting wasn't anything special (though Joseph G-L is always good) but I like that the film is open to many interpretations. <br/><br/>Hate is useless, if you aren't beging constructive then it's not helping anyone.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[6]]<br/>Yeah, its nicely shot and has bendy, Escher-type effects, but apart from that I don't see the fuss.  The what-is-reality is interesting but its dragged down by the clunk fest dialogue. Does every character have to exposit everything at every stage, several times over?! Was it really necessary for Cobb in that first/second dream sequence to explain everything in such minutiae (to his client of all people!) only to have the same discussion again in 'real life' five mins later. And no questions asked about his crazy pants client - trusted completely it seems.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[8]]<br/>I think the biggest Inception or Idea placed into an subconscious mind is on the viewer. With any movie in the modern day times is what is the movie out to achieve? Answer: Bucket loads of cash. By overloading the brain with ideas and clues you create a "WTF just happened". Eventually the Inception that is placed into own your brain is "I have to watch that again". So you come back the next day and still have no idea, so you come back again. What a great way to make money. BTW I absolutely loved the it!</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[0]]<br/>expanding a little..<br/><br/>The ending owes a lot to Bladerunner's "Is Deckard a replicant?" ending, but Ridley Scott actually had something to say.<br/><br/>The lack of moral compass in the whole idea of "good guys" working for some corporate (who does what?), to get into other corporates minds to steal, is a little disturbing. What kind of message is being sent to the kids here?<br/><br/>Women-folk don't get a very good rap in this film either, always getting into you brain and trying to knock off your buddies, keep you at home and giving your new chick a hard time. <br/></p>

I was falling asleep during the first half, which spent way too long setting up the second half, by which time the premise had been hammered home so hard that I didn't care anymore. Lame.

Everything works and Chris Nolan does a terrific job at bringing this strange, unusual and gripping world to life. Full of emotion and creative action sequences, this is a must-see.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/>So what if its not the best story ever told? So you don't care about the whole mythology/archetypes parallels in the characterisation. This is brilliant contemporary science fiction. And what good scifi does, is make you believe that this could be real. 2001 did do that, but we no longer have much doubt about what the future holds for humanity, not like in the 60s. This? This is so real I can nearly taste it, and that kind of movie doesn't happen a lot. Film making isn't just about stories anymore people!</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[5]]<br/>This movie failed for me- there is no story.  Its key theme is "what is reality?".  That is not enough of a premise for  a film, or at least my idea of a great film.  Same reason why Phillip K. Dick was merely interesting sc-fi writer, but not great writer- a story cannot be built just on gimmiky ideas about technology and reality, or great imagery alone.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/>Absolutely Wonderful.<br/><br/>Cinematography, music, storytelling, were all brilliant. Favourite movie of the year, and definitely the best movie that i have seen in a long time. The hotel scene was one of the biggest standouts for me, and the scenes toward the end of the film were so heartfelt and beautiful.<br/><br/>To all those who say it was too confusing, i suggest you see it a second time. It made sense to me, but a second viewing also clarifies many plot points, and you also pick up on details you may have missed.<br/><br/>Incredible work, Christopher Nolan. You are an inspiration.</p>

The storytelling was fantastic, and i loved how each element of the plot seemed to tie together towards the second half of the film. The cinematography is SO beautiful, Nolans aesthetic is truely wonderful and the hotel scene is honestly one of the best fight scenes i have seen in many, many years. One of the things that really stuck out for me was the soundtrack. It was haunting and perfectly complemented each image that was presented.<br/><br/>Amazing work, Christopher Nolan.

Two people had no clue what the hell was going on by 20 mins in and came out absolutely clueless. Not easy to understand at all. Its true what people are saying that you need to see it twice.</p>

No, this is one for the believers, and if you fail to be swept away by its fabulously high technology wizardry and portentously mysterious script, you will just tune out and stop paying attention for any meaning.  Like many of these in-your-face adrenalin-charged American blockbusters, it falls in love with its own imagery and importance, and it could easily have left half an hour on the cutting-room floor.  Surely, after the high stress of this one and the equally disturbing 'Shutter Island', Di Caprio might need a little R&amp;R.</p>

People on this forum may knock it for character depth and soundtrack monotony but give credit where its due..I saw it in the cinema last nite and saw the look on peoples faces and felt the vibe when the credits started to role...the audience was mesmerised and that says it all to me. Smart guy Dicaprio... chooses his roles very well....</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[6]]<br/>In terms of entertainment value, this film provides enough intrigue and action to warrant a visit.<br/><br/>I've analysed though why this just didn't do it for me personally.  When you see a magic show, if you know that it isn't real magic and know how the trick is actually done, the supposed magic has you yawning.  I find that overt special effects are the same - when I know that's obviously an effect, it has little impact on me apart from distraction.   <br/><br/>A little too heavy on the effects and not enough on building real tension.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/>I am amazed with some comments here. We thought it was the best movie we saw in 2 years, walked out of the cinema dazzled and talked about its conception for two hours in a cafe, thinking we were in a different world. Yes, if  brainless entertainment is what you expect form a movie , you will be walking out perhaps. If you are open minded, like artistic creation and movie plot that actually gets you thinking, I cannot imagine why you wouldn't be enthralled!  I thought the music was great too, appropriate for the movie atmosphere...</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/>Quite hilarious that a number of people are rating this movie lowly because they either didn't get it or just resent such blatant and comprehensive genius.<br/>Massively advanced from Nolan's previous films but not possible without the skills and insights he has developed elsewhere, Inception is genuinely breathtaking. The parallel of a genuinely original film that ponders the very origin of original thought is typical of other nice pairings and reflections throughout.<br/>It's simply an essential cinematic experience not done justice by words like these.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/>I am genuinely STUNNED at the number of people who despised this film; I thought it was one of the most original, thought-provoking and thrilling films I have ever seen, ever. Miles ahead of 2001: A Space Odyssey, one of the most self-indulgent, self-aware, pretentious and nauseating films I've ever had the misfortune to suffer through. If Nolan doesn't bring home the Oscar for this, someone in the Academy needs to be shot. I literally had no idea how divisive this film would be. I suppose the naysayers are saying the same thing though...</p>

The movie was below my expectations; I expected more fantasy/CGI stuff, like you would expect in a movie about dreams. I reckon The Dark Knight (Nolan's previous film) was much better than Inception. I still really liked the music though, just like it was in The Dark Knight. You rock, Hans Zimmer!!!</p>

We felt dragged on in the end.  <br/><br/>We did have a higher expectation from this film and felt disappointed when we walked out of the cinema.  Tell me why the young lady in the film was critical?  This is the film that either you love it or hate it!  No higher score from us I am afraid.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[9]]<br/>SPOILER ALERT ....<br/>What I really liked about this film was the story about the wife who didn't believe she was awake. I wondered if this was referring to the psychological phenomena of depersonalization where the person feels like their world is not real: as if they are living in a dream. There was plenty of other great elements too: the suspense towards the end, as well as the reference to the movie Citizen Kane about what is important in life. I don't usually like violence but the action was okay too as in dreams anything can happen.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[1]]<br/>To a relentlessly ominous soundtrack, which bears no relation to the changes in event or dream level, the charmless L de Caprio and sidekicks spend their screentime explaining to each other the inner mechanics of the plot between gunshots and car collisions. I must be dreaming! Can 5 minutes really feel like 4 hours? In this cinema it does. Ellen, Tom, Joseph - come on, you're way above this! An hour into this bludgeoning melodrama, I walked out.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[5]]<br/>Hmmm. Should have called it: "The Kids, The Wife, and a CEO who wants a lot of Money". Great hooks Nolan. Oppressive soundtrack from Zimmer. Lacking in subtlety on all fronts I would say. Nolan's films really starting to feel like huge long montages. And the repetitive stuff: falling car, guy bleeding, dudes shooting, falling car, guys shooting, dude bleeding, it was just - repetitive. An otherwise finished, and complete film, with little surprise, but some nice moments. Memento. Now there's a classic.</p>

Interesting ideas for a mainstream film but I do not think it is as original as they make it out to be. The shared dream plot has been used in dozens of Saturday morning cartoons in the 80s from Ninja Turtles to the Gargoyles. I think I even saw an episode of Bravestarr  where he shared a dream with his horse. <br/><br/>So its nothing new but it did look good. Joseph G-Levitt was great as always.<br/></p>

Leaving obvious similarities with the Matrix to one side this film had me enthrawled. I love Christopher Nolan's films. The Dark Knight and Inception are nothing but the best two films of the decade. The music is awesome and the photography. I'm going to see it again. I saw the Dark Knight four times.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[9]]<br/>This is one heck of an amazing film bound to be a classic, and I don't just mean the CGI which are also very impressive. It's layer upon layer of story within story, that one begins to marvel how nested dreams can get. I suspect people who are comfortable with postmodern concepts of shifting frames of reference will immediately understand this tale. The only detraction is the rather conventional ending where the protagonist has to battle and win against his inner demon.</p>

From the bad make up job on KEN WATANABE (Benjamin Button bad) we labour to the predictable climax. It's almost as annoying as Groundhog Day, but  they replace "I Got You Babe." with Edith Piaf's beautiful coffee song and murder it along with hundreds of people. IA dream within a dream within yet another dream, Yawn! How bout some light and shade? Some character development? Some subtlety? It died but I didn't wake up...</p>

Why splice in a pathetic James Bond style action sequence in the middle of this - oh I know why, to please the audience of 13 year old boys Hollywood believes are the main audience for films.  There isn't really anything amazing to "get" either.  Disappointed.  Do not ever mention this and Blade Runner in the one sentence again.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[4]]<br/>Dreams are supposed to be dreamy. This film has no mystery or heart. The characters don't have deep relationships with each other so it's hard to care about them or care if they live or die. This film is being compared to the Matrix, but isn't as conceptually interesting. "Inception" is better than most action movies but it was hardly a masterpiece. About 3/4 of the way through I realised I didn't know what was going on and I didn't care either!</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[7]]<br/>Up until about half-way into this movie I thought it was one of the best movies I'd see in ages. It had me guessing and wondering what was real and what was not. Then it got too caught up in itself and was ruined by going on for far too long. By the end I was just glad to  leave so I could get on with my life.<br/><br/>I can understand all the positive comments though. Inception is intelligent, thought-provoking and well-acted. Ultimately though, it is also overindulgent, showcasing what can be done with a big Hollywood budget.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[5]]<br/>David and Margaret gave it 4.5, but why?<br/><br/>I thought the characters were cliched and poorly developed, the plot relied on the old Hollywood staples of gunfights and car chases, when dreams can be so much more. They had a blank canvas and painted by the numbers.<br/><br/>On the plus side, it's technically brilliant, with no dodgy looking CGI, so top marks there.<br/><br/>Most of all, the film lacked a soul. Yes, Leo wants to get home, but unlike other similar stories (The Matrix, Alice in Wonderland) I didn't care if he made it.</p>

It just did not take the concept far enough or should I say Deep enough to create that lingering feeling a great film leaves you with.  The potential was there.The desire to fill the quota of gunshots and special FX instead of tackling the human side of the  idea disappoints me. Cast was great but stand out is Tom Hardy , a great charachter actor getting some Big screen time, finally!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>

Unfortunately for me, you will have thousands agreeing with you that this was a good movie.

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[6]]<br/>Lots to like in this film so I'll cut to why I didn't love it.  Firstly I wanted a more ambigous - dream like - unconcious.  One more like my dreams.  My dreams aren't like action films? It didn't feel like a dream to me - more a fantasy.  Also, the most interesting idea to me was that the hero wanted to ignore reality and live in the dream world with his partner, which has so many interesting connotations about mutual addiction and addictive relationships, and somehow that never felt real becuase of the children and the 'hollywood' morality feel.</p>

All i can say for now is i think truly great films dont require more than one viewing to truly understand and appreciate what it has to offer. I'm sure this is a great film and a masterpiece in it's own way, it's just going to take me 10 hours to realise it! Some terrific special effects and a very creative and unique story is why this gets 3 stars.</p>

I was waiting to wake up from this movie thinking it was a dream! I thought nothing could be made like this. I was one of the few who understood 2001: A Space Odessy and one of the few who got Inception but none the less its bend around ever coner, top notch preformances, visuals, and themes make this the peobably one of the best films of the year so far.

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[1]]<br/>An empty, shallow experience, an overcooked souffle that collapses into meaninglessness - high concept rubbish  devoid of humanity. <br/><br/>"Compassion at its heart"?!  This film doesn't have a heart - at best, a gall bladder of sentimentality. <br/><br/>"So many interpretations"?! There is no mystery. The whole thing takes place within the sleeping brain of the protagonist - none of the dazzling mechanics of the story merit any serious consideration.

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/>A modern classic no doubt. Inception is destined to become revered. I am not usually drawn to this sort of movie. The Matrix series left me a bit cold but this is so brilliantly imagined and handled it somehow becomes sort of plausible. Easily the movie of the year for me so far.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[1]]<br/>I came out of this movie not knowing if they had succeeded in their objective to plant an idea in the brain of Robert Fischer Jr, the heir to a rival business empire. For corporate espionage, it's too over the top, too complicated, too mind boggling for me. Not at all enjoyable. Di Caprio's typical overacting made it intolerable. He'd be far better as the Marlboro man. Echoes of William Burroughs in the plot which seemed to lose itself descending down each level in a state torn between Super Mario and opiate-like confusion.</p>

It was created to leave you analysing, deciphering what was going on in the movie. I still think it was Cobb who is no longer in touch with reality anymore, he is trapped within his own dreams and won't let his mind move on till the end, but he is still stuck.....</p>

It seemed that a worthy subject-dreams and their importance and their symbolism, was hijacked by the Hollywood machine and turned into a 'blow 'em up or shoot 'em' excuse for entertainment.

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[0]]<br/>Conceptually interesting and not unilke a Matrix of the mind, this film's delivery and execution falls nowhere near its promise. Despite some fair acting (de Caprio and support do their best), the movie's pretentiousness, wooden  and confused script, trite good/bad character dichomoty, and its over-reliance on special effects to woo Gen Ys, makes this piece of garbage unwatchable. Overpitched and overblown, this dreary attempt at a look beyond the mind's horizon (think early 'Twilight Zone' or 'Outer Limits') is downright boring. My worst cinema experience in 8 years.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[1]]<br/>I agree completely with PaulD, I don't understand what M&amp;D saw in this overly complicated, way-too-long snore-fest and the score was too much; I felt like it was building to a crescendo from about a third of the way in. Also, the complex, potentially interesting notion that was introduced to us as inception was destroyed by the amateur-ish reason of 'break up the family empire'. They even had to write it on a white board so we didn't forget it. Did anyone notice Leonardo call Ellen Page by her real name rather than Ariadne when she was on the balcony?</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[9]]<br/>4 and 1/2 stars as there are unaviodable flaws, but overall great. To me it was like someone finally made a good William Gibson movie. Tom Hardy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are brilliant, and as a hetrosexual male might I say extremely handsome. Even Leo pushes his acting all the way (OK he crinkles his face up to show deep thought, but hey, it's a start). The action was surprising and well executed,  the love story sad and tragic, with some entertaining puzzles thrown in. Also: signature Christopher Nolan esablishing city shots (beautiful) What more could you want?</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[4]]<br/>A good idea spoiled. The movie delivered exactly what it suggested - that they implant and idea in someone's head and that the lead character manages to come to terms with the death of his wife. Not a single twist. Add to this that it was padded by an hour and a half of gratuitous and tedious gun play (yes I get it - the defences of the subjects mind resisting the invaders), as well as another poor performance by DiCaprio, who looks like a man trying hard to act and a disappointing appearance by the normally engaging Ellen Page.</p>

Its been ages since I've seen a movie that I still think about days afterwards, on that simple measure alone it deserves 4+ stars<br/><br/>I can see how some people do not like it for its very 'hollywood' elements.  But the story/premise underpinning the movie is so well done.<br/><br/>I think if this movie had of been made in a different time.(ie so you stripped away all the technology glitz) it would be widely regarded as a classic.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[9]]<br/>I'm already eagerly awaiting my next viewing of Inception. I'm digesting what I have just seen, but what I do know is that Inception is going to devide movie-goers. Like other genre classics like Blade Runner, Dark City, Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind and, to a lesser extent, The Matrix, this is a film which just may just be a little too ahead of its time and will probably find a whole new group of admirers once people have had a chance to sit down to multiple viewings and been able to disect it and analyse its true meaning.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[9]]<br/>Di Caprio is solid but I think Ellen Page was the anchor of the whole story. <br/>It took me about 20 minutes to start to comprehend the messages in the film and I think it is a quite basic (yet very important warning) of beware of corporatisation of the planet. The premise of modern day capitalism evolving into nothing more than evil monopolistic entities that wish to control humans including their so called leaders - the politicans.<br/> A good American movie because of this message otherwise it could be interpretated as  just a lot of whiz bang.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[5]]<br/>The effects are amazing - particularly the non CGI parts, but this can't carry a film alone. It seemed to begin in mid-action sequence, have no points of diffuse until BAM, 2.5 hours later, the end. One huge action sequence with only enough dialogue to explain the action sequence.<br/>What I really have a problem with is that there was absolutely no character development at all, aside from Cobb's (rather predictable) background. I walked out after the end and realized that I couldn't remember a single support characters names - because they didn't have characters at all!<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[5]]<br/>I don't understand what all the fuss is about, frankly. OK, so the movie has a reasonably inventive plot, and the idea of implanting ideas is an intriguing one. But I felt that it went for around an hour too long- the scenes in the snow are particularly tiresome- and that it was a lot of show, and little substance. And some of the plot devices were so clumsy e.g. the fact that the sedative "just so happened" not to disturb balance, as to be laughable.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[9]]<br/>I don't think it's an instant classic, I don't think there is such a thing, but it's a very cleverly contrived and exciting film which uses the cinematic medium to the max and gives you a couple of hours of real enjoyment. <br/><br/>It's not overly cryptic or difficult to follow, and it definitely  lags in a few places. I found it less emotionally gripping than Memento and less tight in the storytelling. <br/><br/>But it was great fun and shines like a diamond amidst the summer dross that surrounds it. <br/><br/>NB: Joseph Gordon-Levitt is VERY like Heath Ledger facially!</p>

Way to keep up certain stereotypes of ignorance. <br/>This movie was creative and had me at the edge of the seat to find out what would happen in the end. The ONLY thing I didn't like was near the end, all of a sudden the architect says, "Oh I have this idea all of a sudden, we can just go deeper f*** it". That's the only flaw I see in it.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[8]]<br/>The characters are not as involving as The Matrix main 3.  The beginning is disorientating.  The ending overly drawn out then seems to skip a beat.<br/>The basic plot and last dream/reality scenes are very good.  Despite outlandish CGI, somehow doesn't have the impact Matrix, Bladerunner, 2001 had in their time.   Missing the bullet dodging slo-mo!  Did not appear as complex as the brilliant Mulholland Drive, but interesting.  Worth a second view on DVD. I thought there was going to be another twist at the end with a Is that the wife?</p>

People who were not swayed by the perfect representation of the science of dream manipulation must rethink if they have even the tiniest bit of imagination. Christopher Nolan is a genius, and it is not fair to compare it to other cult classics.It definitely stands in the norm of its own.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[6]]<br/>I completely disagree with these reviews. I think this film has some good moments and a fantastic premise but I think Shutter Island is far more interesting. Inception is just a mind bending Bond film with no Bond girls. I think Nolan's lack of imagination is on display really. The dream worlds are really not unlike the non dream worlds. <br/><br/>A highly overrated film. Simply telling a story three times at once doesn't make it any more interesting. However the different time zones worked well. <br/><br/>Has merit but really not worth the amount of reverence it is getting.</p>

This film, of course has flaws, and it's certainly not everyone's cup of tea. In fact i'm surprised so many mainstreamers  are rating it. However, for sheer effort and intelligent design this film must rate highly as it nullifies much of the rubbish that is strewn out of world cinema these days and attempts to enter places that we've only glimpsed before in cinema. This was a fantastic film that could have, should have been a masterpiece!</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/>A blast, an intellectual diamond. Brilliant, incredible. Sporadic notions thrown at the audience non-stop, a flurry of lessons into the dream world in the form of an impenetrable filmmaking schema that should be copied but never will. No cloudy demonstrations that this film is perfectly illogical because it's completely coherent. The highly imaginative screenplay reeks of ingenuity. The editing will surely win an Oscar, folding over ideas and yet it all make sense, incorporating fantastic imagery which is as inventive as it is meaningful.<br/></p>

Dreams within dreams and an ending that makes the audience go "ooohhh" in unison.  Was there anything really that complicated in this movie?  I am a huge fan of "The Matrix", this film felt like it took it a bit deeper, but I never really felt that attached to the characters.  It was a typical heist/con movie.

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[9]]<br/>It's definitely going to polarise people - you'll either lover it (as I did) or hate it with a passion (as my partner did).<br/>It's one of those films that you think you've figured out, but then you realise that there's more to the film than the first viewing. For example - why was there a train barreling down the middle of the city street in the "1st level dream". If it wasn't put their by the architect - then where did it come from?

I   sat through  40 minutes of  this movie and left.  Perhaps  where   we  differ is  that   I go to the movies to be entertained  not  to impress bu my intellectual understanding  of what  might be the  story behind  an absolute impossibility.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/>Christopher Nolan is such an impressive filmmaker and writer. I love how complex this movie is. It's detailed to the limit, and all the layers of detail give us quite a confusing time. The action sequences are terrific, and the special effects have been used so well. The cinematography is beautiful, and Han Zimmer's score is brilliant. I loved the acting, especially from Marion Cotillard- she was fantastic. Overall, I reckon this is the best film of 2010.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/>I just figured out what this movie is about: the message - it's an anti war movie, the messages are delivered by the architect ie. the writer, in boxes and via layers and DiCaprio's characters tells you how to figure the maze out,  you'll just have to think about it. Clearly Margaret and David are still thinking about it. It's unbelievable this movie was allowed to be made in America. But absolutely off this planet fantastic movie. Misha.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[7]]<br/>Not great science fiction. The director got carried away with the special effects, which were spectacular, and forgot to make a gripping story. Much of the effects were unecessary. The plot was complex, too complex, I was struggling to work out where they were. There is a soft spot between facile and bewildering and this didn't find it. You shouldnt have to go to repeat sessions to enjoy a movie. The acting was ok, the music loud but I didn't mind it. Too cute.</p>

But if you are not prepared to pay attention completely for 2 hours you will not enjoy this. This is certainly not a drop-your-brain-at-the-door Michael Bay orgy of violence. Hell there isn't even a bad guy. And I am absolutely grateful for it. It is so refreshing to see a film that doesn't treat its audience like morons.</p>

Blade Runner comparisons are not inappropriate but I didn't find the plot inaccessible or mysterious and there were a couple of 'get on with it' and 'enough with the bang-bang' moments.<br/>I'll see it again on DVD.<br/><br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[9]]<br/>I thought that this movie was amazing. The acting was great, especially Joseph-Gordon Levitt, who usually takes on less serious roles. The offset of flinty humour smoothed out the tense atmosphere and allowed the viewer to become fully submerged in the plotline.<br/>And the ending, for me, was the best part. Big movies like this always feel the need to have a conclusive, happy, concrete ending, so it was refreshing to leave the theatre with something to think about, and not to have your mind made up for you.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/>One of the most thrilling movies I've ever seen with a stellar supporting cast.  Oscar-winning performances undoubtedly.  My friend and I disagree about who the old man was (at the beginning and end of the movie) - can anyone enlighten us?<br/><br/>Will be seeing it a second time and hopefully a couple of things will slot into place though generally I think I had a handle on the whole concept.</p>

I didn't find the story too obscure or too convoluted and just went along for the ride. I felt that Ellen Page was excellent and couldn't help thinking that she would be perfect as Lisbeth in Girl with Dragon Tat (think hard candy).</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[4]]<br/>Pretentious and masquerading as high art. All the cliches are there from the car chases and gunfire to the heist and caper scenarios much like the dreadful Oceans films.It feels more like moving through a multi layer computer game than a well structured and intelligent film and all the CGI in the world can't change that. What exactly was Cobb's special talent? He was the least able and likeable of the characters. Disappointed.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[2]]<br/>David's review says: "at first viewing......is not easy to comprehend fully".  Boy, did he get that right.  But then for him to suggest: "..will repay many viewings in order to grasp all the intricate details.....", he's got to be joking.  I couldn't stand to sit through it ever again.  Despite the theme of entering into people's dreams it is essentially a typical expensive  Hollywood film with lots of tedious and boring car chases and people getting killed while the heroes survive.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[9]]<br/>Yes, great film-making here in all aspects. I wonder why I can't give it five stars? Can only think that there was some emotional or spiritual element missing for me because I was so deep inside my intellectual mind for the whole film in order to stay on top of the plot. All that fragmenting cityscape was perhaps a bit superfluous, but at least it looked great. And Marion Cotillard got to wear some great dresses - another quarter star for that. The gotta-see movie of the year thus far.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[7]]<br/>It was good for an action blockbuster type movie but had the same flaws as the others. The characters were absolutely flat and apart from DiCaprio's character we know absolutely nothing about them.<br/>The actions sequences were visually brilliant but again they felt so much like any other movie where the bad guys can never ever hit the target while the goodies seem to only need one bullet every time. <br/>The storyline was very good and intriguing which made it rise above the traditional action blockbuster but truthfully it was overrated</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/>This is a Legendary Feature Release, the idea of infultrating the victims minds, the idea of a dream, inside a dream, inside a dream, inside a dream is amazing. The cinematography is skilled, the music score is tense &amp; dark  which suits this film, the direction is perfect &amp; the performances are spot-on!<br/><br/>I can assosiate this film as one of my favorite films of all time, and i reckon this will be a breakthrough benchmark of all science-fiction movies!!! :) <br/><br/>4.5? What are you thinking?<br/><br/>MODERATOR: 4.5 stars out of 5 stars...</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[9]]<br/>Having seen the film I totally agree with this review. The films plotline is actually very simple, it's the reasoning and the side stories that weave together wonderfully that makes this film so good. I love all the performances, especially Ellen Page as the curious and incredulous apprentice, and Cobbs wife, who has an eerily evil presence and a fantastic sense of incompleteness. Altogether, this is one that will stay in my most loved movie collection for years.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[6]]<br/>Tired of yanks spelling it all out for us - too much in the way of "this is how it works" dialogue - didn't leave much for us to discover. CGI was predictable, and at the James Bond bits: boom boom explosives snow snowsleds etc. it got a bit tiring. What is boring is that there are no "over 50s" women in these films. First film I've been to the cinema in ages - and last if the previews showing other 'bang bang' movies are any indication of what the viewing public are zombiefied with. 3 stars is for Leo.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[1]]<br/>You know you're in trouble when the script spends its time making up, then breaking the rules as it goes.  Not to mention neglects to introduce any really likeable characters and then compounds its other flaws by telegraphing the end from light years away.<br/><br/>Only time Ive ever been at a movie where I missed not wearing a watch.  If I had, then I'd have had something else to look at than the movie.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/>Amazing. I've never seen anything like it. The concept was genius, the acting superb and the script brilliant.It's so good to see a holywood movie make you think like that and not overload with special effects, although the special effects here are mind-bogglingly good. Christopher Nolan is a genius and Leonardo Dicaprio was very good too. Mesmerising is the right word i think. Mesmerising</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/>One of the finest cinematic adventures of the decade. Every element of film-making blends so harmoniously and intelligently here; the acting is superb, the story is mind-bogglingly clever, the score is so powerful, the effects are constantly mesmerising, the cinematography keeps up brilliantly with the action. There are more memorable moments in this film than in any other in recent memory, the Paris explosions and the corridor fight come to mind. Christopher Nolan is a master of his craft... do not miss this!</p>

Even more preposterous, however, is the rating given by Margaret and David.  What were they thinking?  They made me believe I was in for a real cinematic treat.  There were some good effects and it was executed well by the actors which is why it gets two stars instead of none but in the end, I really didn't care.<br/><br/>Shame on you M &amp; D</p>

So does Ellen Page, wonderful.<br/><br/>This is a long, convoluted film.<br/><br/>It has some oustanding unique visuals I've never seen before.  <br/><br/>Even though you lose the meaning of the plot because of its complexity, I found I just sat back and enjoyed the ride.<br/><br/>Some of the edited action scenes are not comprehensible.  <br/><br/>Also Watanabe's dialogue is almost incomprehensible, but he speaks mainly only in the beginning of the film so this is OK.<br/><br/>Worth seeing on the big screen, and better than the average Hollywood flick, but in the end only average overall.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/>This movie picked me up and swept me along for the tidal wave rush of a ride. There were times when I thought I was watching a James Bond movie for grown ups. Dazzlingly  photographed, a wonderful music score, a complex story brilliantly told and all performed by a cast of actors who made you believe it was all happening. A MUST SEE film, litterally to the very last frame.  Bravo Mr. Nolan and everyone involved.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/>Inception actually does to the audience what the characters set out to do... it plants a seed in your mind that grows uncontrollably, the idea the makes unpredictable twists and turns well after the credits have finished rolling and as Cobb (DiCaprio) notes, it cannot be forgotten.<br/><br/>Brilliant in design.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/>This movie lived up to all of my expectations. It's a shame that I won't really fully understand the film until it's out on DVD (so I can watch it as many times as I want). From the packed cinema, I think that this film will go very far indeed. Well done to Christopher Nolan and the others who contributed to the final product.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[9]]<br/>Exceptional film where action sequences are actually used to push the plot along for a change... it's an interesting premise that i lost myself in &amp; it was all tied together with a neat little twist. <br/>You need to concentrate throughout the film because the plot isn't spoon fed to you. But when it all comes together, you're rewarded with a great story that affects you subconsciously. It's refreshing to see a film where the director treats its audience with intelligence!</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/> Inception is a fabulous high quality heist movie in  which nothing is taken: instead an idea is implanted: in the mind of a mark(Murphy) but also the audience.But its also a journey into the underworld...and calls to mind the story of Orpheus and Eurydice...and his journey to rescue his wife from death.<br/> With a great cast of characters playing off one another, and an Ariadne who both creates mazes, as well leading us thru Inception. Loved the scenes in the dreams when the van is in freefall or roling down the slope....as if in a dream!</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[8]]<br/>Really great in many respects. <br/><br/>Kudos to Nolan for pushing his ambitious story ideas all the way, although for this reason there are people who will just be confused by the film.<br/><br/>I want to see it again because I, too, was somewhat confused - but not due to the storytelling. It was the film's overly-noisy and hyperactive shootouts and car chases, which for me ended up obscuring or killing certain plot points.<br/><br/>Oh, and enough already  with the silly aural shocks and cues; such cheap post-production tricks belong in far lesser films - and inevitably in trailers of course.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[9]]<br/>Truly a brilliant film, shot beautifully and realised almost perfectly through all of its complexities.<br/>Although it is through its complexities that I personally think it is so difficult to comprehend in some scenes given it is such a deep, thought-provoking concept, and one that could be arguably explored much further. Not that it really needed to for the purpose of the film. Although still, it is the reasoning behind the four and a half stars (provided by myself).<br/>In any case, it is a truly original film, and  one that stays in your thoughts long after the credits. Highly recommended.</p>

Stimulating and challenging "levels" of dreams and time, through excellent characterization, amazing scenes and thought provoking conclusion.  <br/>Would love to see the complexities of the storyboard!  <br/>After the rave reviews and obvious delight of this movie by both Margaret and David we expected the highest accolade of fives.

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[5]]<br/>Too complex by far.  This is not a film that you can relax and enjoy - your mind is in overdrive, trying to work out which plane of reality you are in at any given moment.  Terrific acting performances by all concerned, but the plot was too heavily interwoven. Certainly not a classic, David !</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[9]]<br/>Films that hit the heart as well as the imagination always rate high. This one has intrigue on both fronts. Include a bewilderment aspect and you start wondering what scene matches with which other. It's a whirl of complexity yet can be fathomed almost satisfactorily in the end.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/>Its so refreshing to see a movie these days that makes you think!Finally a storyline that is original and is showcased in the directors vision (not the studio's).Hopefully this movie will set a seed of change in Hollywood and inspire many others.It hooks you from the moment it starts until the end. An overload of the mind and the senses.I feel grateful to live in an age to see this type of vision come alive on the screen. No other words to say other than...Go see this movie people, you will walk out of the cinema speechless!!</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[4]]<br/>Really wasn't sure what to make of this.  Enjoyed The Dark Knight but found this tedious beyond belief.  Points to Nolan for trying something different but the film doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be a clever psychological suspense thriller or a shout and shoot action flick. Slick visuals and CGI, car chases and gun battles for the metroplex crowd.  For those having trouble with the plot, don't worry the characters continually 'explain' what they are doing, where they are going, where they have been.  Flatliners meets The Matrix meets Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless MInd.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[8]]<br/>Some of the action, especially towards the end, felt like it was forced in by studio execs, and wasn't all that well done either. A very interesting film conceptually, but if you're going to subject me to more car chases and Alpine shootouts you had better give them early Woo levels of excitement.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[4]]<br/>I have been trying to work out for the last 4 days what went wrong. I saw inception on Monday night at a private screening with very high hopes but was left utterly deflated. Every one I spoke to that night raved about it and when I checked online reviews those opinions were mirrored. All I saw that night was a cross between Oceans 11 and The Matrix, no internal logic and a main character I couldnt sympathise with. I had hoped that David or Margeret would save me but now I am more confused than ever.</p>

The story is incredible, direction great, special effects out of this world, Zimmers music again masterful and the acting excellent. Decaprio just goes from strength to strength, Page and Cotillard wonderful and Cillian Murphy great as all the cast were.

I saw it twice, once on regular screen and then two days later on large IMAX screen, both of course in 2D.  Even during the second viewing I just could not get up out of my seat in fear of missing something important.  I saw so much more detail and I found understanding during the second viewing.  Really a marvelous movie and honestly the best I have seen in years, it's a real classic!</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/>Thinking about the films I've rated 5-stars this last decade -- ones that left me in awe, taking days to fully process -- Inception has them all beat. <br/><br/>There is so much in this film, the fact that it works at all is impressive. The fact that it works so well makes it an instant classic. Performances by all were terrific, but the highest praise has to go to Christopher Nolan.<br/><br/>Directors of his calibre are so rare, writer-directors more so. He is a true visionary, and this film cements his place as one of the greatest of all time.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[6]]<br/>Very overrated. The Matrix is a far better film. Where was the atmosphere, the mood, the skill in storytelling? Compare the mood of the Matrix, the skill of the exposition and the development of the story - it was done with patience, immersing you. It took its time and set itself up for a sequel. Inception tried to do everything in one movie. The development of story and concept was rushed,the atmosphere lacking, the action average. On the other hand, concepts of time and dream within a dream, and playing with gravity, were awesome. Good gimmicks/effects, average storytelling.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[2]]<br/>One of the worst films I have seen in years.  I found the unrelenting thunderous soundtrack nauseating.  It makes the dialogue almost unintelligible and  the viewer into thinking there is something special going on.  There isn't.  Nolan actually  prevents the  viewer from thinking about the film.  It is all sound and fury, signifying nothing.  I am bewildered that both David and Margaret rated this so highly and I am appalled that David mentioned it in the same company of '2001' - for me, the finest film ever made.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[9]]<br/>INCREDIBLE. It was hard to really let myself sink back into the story, and get swept away with the genius of it, because my mind was distracted with trying to keep up with what was going on... So I will need to go back, and watch it again to really appreciate this film for all it has to offer. But from my first experience, I found Inception to be compelling, and absolutely thrilling to watch. I was blown away with the complexity of the story... it was visually stunning... and the 'confused gravity' fight scene had me in absolute awe!</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[6]]<br/>First half was simply brilliant, but the third act really lets this film down. What *was* an intelligent, compelling high-concept drama becomes just another action movie; characters become secondary to stunts and explosions, and Cobb's limbo 'confession' is too far removed from Mal's earlier intrusions (which, in hindsight, seem awfully similar to 'Flatliners') to hold any weight. Three stars.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[8]]<br/>I know David didn't strictly compare this to Blade Runner or 2001, but his mention of them led me to (subconsciously perhaps) expect an experience near that level. D'oh! It was pretty darn terrific, especially compared to most other offerings, but not quite on par with my overly high expectations. Having said that, there is a lot to rave about, especially Di Caprio's performance, the wonderful unfolding of the story and great use of top-notch CGI.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[7]]<br/>It hides behind a myriad of stunning visual effects instead of delievering something of true substance. Yes its well paced and well acted, but at its heart is a story trying to be more than it really is. The movie perhaps does too well in explaining it's mythology with each step handed to the audience without leaving any questions to be answered. Except an ending which just seems to have been tossed in with little care. I enjoyed it, but it follows too closely a recipe of how to create a classic movie, without realising recipes are open to interpretation.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[8]]<br/>Just got back from a screening and I'm extremely happy with the results. I must say, while I think it's one of Nolan's best films, it's not THE best. The young auteur has given us a film that touches greatness but can't maintain it for the full length. Lack of character development and deliberately vague expository dialogue are only minor quibbles, in a film that soars to incredible heights of ambition. This is great cinema, this is why we go to the movies.</p>

Some clever ideas and a lot of good acting, for sure. But, for example, Blade Runner is much more emotionally absorbing and satisfying. Anyway, a good film experience, to be sure, to be sure.</p>

A genre-redefining classic? Perhaps...</p>

Not to mention Han Zimmer's score. <br/>There's not much to say, except, GO SEE IT. i really don't know why Dave and Margaret gave this 4.5, when they raved about it.?? I'm sure they'll change their minds.</p>

<p class="comment">((Inception))[[10]]<br/>Why cant all cinema be this good... compelling storyline, brilliant storytelling, (well done nolan in telling it, not easy to do with the concept, camera work is amazing)....it forces you to keep up with it, think for yourself (or you wont keep up!), not just sit there and accept what you see like so many other films.<br/>Acting was great, DiCaprio has not been this good since blood diamond... much more of the same please!!!! (Not sure what held Margaret and David from giving it 5 stars...)</p>
