<h2>The Tree Of Life</h2>
<p><em>Review by Margaret Pomeranz</em></p>
<p>For me this is a most audacious, wonderful film. While it lacks a conventional narrative structure, it has a poetic vision. Early in the film Malick represents the earth's creation and the beginning of life in an awe-inspiring sequence that somehow puts the minute matter of human beings in some sort of perspective, as does the family's relationship to God. <br/><br/>There is a dialectic going on here between the creationism and determinism of God and the forces of evolution. How do we reconcile the beauties, the emotions, the faith of our lives with suffering and death. It is a grand concept that tries to come to grips with the human condition. Some people have called the film pretentious, as if having a grand aim in making a film is somehow embarrassing. <br/><br/>I was incredibly moved by this beautifully made film, I was also challenged by it. It doesn't get much better than that. I cannot wait to see it again.</p>
<h2>Further comments</h2>
<p>MARGARET: David.<br/><br/>DAVID: Well, it's certainly ambitious and I love that about it. I loved that about Malick. I've loved the films he made before this, which are all, in one way or another, about man's fall from grace really. But as we've seen already in Cannes and again when the film showed at the Sydney Film Festival, the film divides audiences dramatically. Now, that's probably a good thing. A lot of people dislike it very much, I guess are bored and don't like the fact that there isn't a conventional narrative.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Poor them.<br/><br/>DAVID: Okay. And other's love the audacity and the vision of it all and I guess I'm somewhere in between. I love the vision. I think there are moments when it almost evokes 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY in its grand vision but I don't think it gets there and it's interesting that he tinkered with the film for a couple of years. It was supposed to be in Cannes a year ago and it has last year's date on it as a copyright date but now he's done a six hour director's cut apparently.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Yummy. <br/><br/>DAVID: But I do think there are elements that don't work. I think the Sean Penn character is poorly integrated into the rest of the film and I think the last part of the film, for me, doesn't work so...<br/><br/>MARGARET: Well, you see, I think this is a very personal film for Malick. He grew up in Texas and I think it is him grappling with major questions of life in his life. He's also an academic, an incredibly bright filmmaker, and a great humanist, I think, and I just - I was incredibly moved and stimulated by this film and I'm giving it a rare 5 stars from me.<br/><br/>DAVID: Okay. I can only give it three.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[0]]<br>I would call the film 'the Feel of Life' , an observation of human development through the white American eyes, the suffering and joy of life. Trying to give meaning of shared experiences within the narrow parameters Old and New Testament fundamentalism,pocket book Freud and just plain luck of the draw.Destiny.. Indifference to a writer/director's efforts is fine if you judge the effort alienating ,long winded,lacking a connect.Nor does everybody get a kick from watching your home movies,youtube,facebook .Introspective stuff.The sweet has to match the fancy wrapping.Chupa chups are so disappointing.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br>This is a most beautiful and poignant portrayal of the path of grief and the depths to which it takes all of us humans.  To contemplate the beginnings of our own life as well as that of the universe at the point of death is something entirely natural and in the end healing.  Terrence Malick I salute you and your colleagues work.  Brilliant!</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br>Oh my. This is a visual poem of heart stopping beauty. This was a total surprise, I had avoided the film for two years because of the indulgent and difficult reputation, but I found this film a totally engaging experience - an absolute milestone in the history of cinema. <br><br>Truly spellbinding and touching, the film is fairly original in its structure and comparisons to 2001: Space Odyssey are quite tenuous because this is an immensely personal film unlike Kubrick's masterpiece. In fact this film has no peers; a poetic meditation on life.</br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[1]]<br>Until this movie, I had never walked out of a theatre before the end. The "Earth Creation" scene was far too long, could have done in a tenth of the time. But wait, it was repeated again further into the movie. By this time I was looking for the exit. The only reason I gave it half a star was because I was able to take a glass of into the theatre.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[4]]<br>it probably goes without saying that although there are parts where this movie is truly engaging, it ultimately fails because the imagery doesn't connect back strongly enough to show a real change or resolution in the main characters (aka the human condition is not fought and resolved).<br><br>This is the movie that Charlie Kaufman would have made if he didn't make "Adaptation" and he wasn't Charlie Kaufman.</br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[8]]<br>There is so much more to this film than one viewing can consider. First, the photography is stunning. The creation of life, the evolution of life, is juxtaposed to creation and evolution of life phases. One is a metaphor for the other yet an entity of its own. The relationship between father and oldest son is typical of that time period. But the father loved his kids but was a product of his time. Jack has to come to terms with his parents' actions: why his father treats him the way he does and why his mother lets it happen.  <br/></br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[0]]<br>This movie transcended disappointment. It was a horrendous attempt to portray a story. <br>We had Gold Cinema Seats. It was a waste of a night out. The only thing preventing us from walking out was the premium price we paid. <br>I sat there at the movies conclusion feeling like I'd had my pockets picked.

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[4]]<br>This movie was most certainly ambitious and had some good cinematography, but in the end it was just so dull. The story was non-existent. I understand it's a meditation on life and all that but it is impossible to be moved in any way by a film that spends more time showing fancy shots of trees than actually developing its characters. This should be shown on the Discovery Channel. In the end all the characters felt one dimensional and uninteresting. This raises the question: do people only like this movie because they believe it makes them sound intelligent and cultured?</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br>You will hate this movie if you want some cheap entertainment thrills.<br><br>If you are somewhat interested in touching some of the deep desires of mankind, and seeing life through another lens,  this is a beautiful artistic expression of another way of thinking about our existence (ie. grace vs nature) and allowing this to enrich your life ... <br><br>The film retells Dale Carnegie book "How to win friends and influence people" in a sligthtly different and  abstract form.</br></br></br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br>I can see why some would call this film pretentious, but it is a valid exploration in to the human condition, and our connection to the divine and nature.<br><br>I think this is a film that wont sit well with people who have not had any form of faith in their upbringing.  Its is about trying to understand what, who we are, where we come from and our connection to something more.<br><br>If you are open to exploring belief in faith (not religion) see this film.  If not, don't.. It will just annoy you. A visually and mentally beautiful film. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br>Because this is an American film set in Texas with Brad Pitt in the lead, I really do believe a lot of people just disregard it as pretentious crap. If it were European it would be globally acknowledged as a masterpiece.<br><br>Pitt, Chastain and the three young actors give remarkable performances that left me totally absorbed from start to finish.<br><br>Yes it taps into spiritual and philosophical areas but don't most Americans (film setting and nationality of Malick) live their lives close to these influences......doesn't that make the film more authentic?<br><br>Brilliant cinematography and score add to the enjoyment. Loved it!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[0]]<br>Sorry, this is torturous. As mentioned, it has some beautiful visuals. But the rest of it feels like I took too many drugs back at Uni....or is that not ENOUGH drugs? yes...i think the latter. Save yourself the torment and dont watch it. Also, save yourself the torment of listening to people wank on about the hidden meaning and deep amazingness by never mentioning it to ANYONE. Seriously, youll be glad you did.</br></p>

But this was the biggest piece of pretentious crap I have ever wasted my time on.  I watched until the end.. two other family members couldn't endure that amount of suffering. There is some beautiful cinematography.. but it's all been strung together in a way that makes your brain bleed. Awful.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[1]]<br>I really really wanted to 'get' this film. Being fairly open minded about film and other art mediums I thought I'd find something valuable.<br>When the dinosaurs came on screen I walked out. Too much try hard stuff in his movie. I could hardly understand Pitt's mumbling and Penn just looked like he was pretending to care. <br>A few positive things are thr cinematography, music and lovely Jessica Chastain. Even those things can't warrant more than half a point.</br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br>I have just finished watching this astounding film at home on DVD. I am glad I didn't see it at the cinema because I would have made a complete fool of myself. I had to stop the film, at one point, to reassemble , I was so overcome . Malick manages to portray the essence of : parental love, prepubescence,  inner conflict, sibling rivalry, jealousy, cruelty,  exquisite tenderness. Magnificent. The performances are faultless. A story with few  words,  just enough to hold the powerful visual narrative together.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br/>I found the film  moving, esp. the relationship of  father and eldest son, true of  50's/60'sDad's conflicted relationships with sons.  I liked Sean Penn the son's maturity yet still wrestling nature, still working things out with Dad perfectly portrayed the human drama for me.  I thought the movie spoke to the innocence and coherence of the family that began in wonder and trust -grace &amp; was later corrupted by nature - the pressure of dealing with an exploitative world that the dad felt. I was relieved at the visions of reconciliation and glad it left a lot open to interpretation.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[4]]<br/>I have a great love for shrubs and other leafy plants. So I got a lot of enjoyment out of seeing a film that finally  took the time to explore foliage at great depths. <br/><br/>I do hope this film is showing the distorted nature with which we view our childhood as something innocent and meaningful because daddy got angry some times and then use it as an excuse for our failures in later life. If so, I think it is a complete success, But sadly i dont think this was the kind of self reflection he was aiming at. <br/><br/></p>

The film captured the essence of childhood in that era.... the characters were so real I could reach out and touch them. Emotions explored in stark reality.... it all fitted so beautifully with the parts making a whole....albeit in a non linear fashion....how true to Life is that??</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[9]]<br/>I started watching this film half expecting to be bored and/or confused by it (having heard some reactions along these lines) but was pleasantly surprised to find it utterly mesmerising. Beautiful, poetic, visually stunning and a very moving experience which will remain with me for a long time. Perhaps just a tad long but this is a minor criticism.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[5]]<br/>I totally give it to David here. The movie was so drawn out that it wasn't interesting in any way. The first hour felt like a national geographic movie. And there is obviously something wrong with Malick mentally because he doesen't even have one interview on the internet..</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[6]]<br/>I have problems with this film. I saw this film with a friend who found it excruciatingly boring and kept wanting to leave. I was enjoying it.The score was fantastic. Absolutely beautiful and a real injustice that the Academy did not even nominate in that category. Nevertheless the film is too long, there isn't a story line and the cutaways add beauty but I couldn't understand the meaning to them. I agree with David this time. It evoked Space Odyssey but unlike that masterpiece it was unable to properly establish itself and was busy establishing itself as something different.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br/>I found this film incredibly moving and inspiring on both a personal and a spiritual level. That the "story" is told in an impressionistic way is perfect and probably necessary given its biographical nature and the incredible pain its making must have evoked for the director, Malik. <br/>Do we need everytlhing in art to be told in a straight forward way? Have we become illiterate to the exploration of the profound and the pain of the personal. A truly courageous film.</p>

Sure the cinematography was impressive but there was no emotional development and it was just plain boring, a shame that the talented actors had there Time wasted so the director could jerk us all off . Seriously if you are considering watching this movie just pull one of your toe nails off , it would give you greater enjoyment.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[1]]<br/>Honestly one of the worst film I have seen in quite some time. When it comes to movies, I have a fairly open mind to all genres and styles but this film was not creative, it was plain boring. I had to fast forward through the first 40 minutes of the film which was like looking at pictures in the national geographic with symphonic music. Then the remainder of the plot was dull. I definitely do not recommend this film.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[6]]<br/>An interesting, hard-to-describe film. The cinematography is amazing, and in my opinion, the standout aspect of the film. The music is stirring, and I thought, fitting for the film. I found the storyline almost nonexistent. I can see that perhaps it is deliberately that way so viewers can make their own interpretations, but for me there were so many gaps and missing links that it really didn't work. Overall, I mostly enjoyed this film, as it celebrates beauty in small things in life.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[2]]<br/>There are plenty of ways to prompt viewers to contemplate the universe and the meaning of life, without resorting to childish metaphors.  The birth sequence was an insult to intelligence.<br/>Critics would say I am not clever or intellectual enough, but its a challenge to evaluate this within the cinematographic lexicon. It's like a mashup of Baraka, 2001: Space Odyssey &amp; acid flashbacks. <br/>For those that like art rather than storytelling you might emerge from this enriched. If you prefer the craft of storytelling, then you will be sadly disappointed, if not outraged at the lost hours of your life.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br/>I saw this when it first came out and I thought I should give it another go. If possible, I liked it even more the second time. The use of Preisner's and Berlioz's Requiem music was inspired, as was the imagery and the breadth of vision. I like the guy who back in July said 'it makes me understand my place in the world' Exactly. Perhaps the people who walked out - shame! weren't ready for such a challenging film. Anyway, I thought it was marvellous</p>

For me, the genius of this film was that it gave me to time to think - to reflect on my own life and how I want to live while I was watching the film. That was novel. I am used to reflecting after I watch a film, but to have the space to do so while watching was so refreshing. It is not entertainment so much as a meditation. Beautiful.<br/></p>

The best film I have ever seen! <br/>I loved how ambitious it was and loved the mosaic-like presentation. The cinematography is extraordinary. I felt like I was watching moving paintings. The music was stunning and complemented the visuals perfectly.<br/>The acting is exquisite. Jessica Chastain is one of my new favourite actresses now.

He used a lot of visual tricks.  <br/><br/>But the film is gratuitous, self possessed in dialog and message.  After the first fifteen minutes, the jig was up.  The rest was torture.<br/><br/>Hey, I like art films, but this gave me an art-attack.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[1]]<br/>Brad Pitt and the children gave a powerful performance, involving the complexities of family dynamics with a difficult father.<br/>The other three quarters of the film had me almost ripping my fingernails off in agony waiting for it to eventually end.

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[9]]<br/>A truely ground-breaking film which tries to do something very different with the medium. Apart from that I found it very beautiful and emotional. Admittedly there are some faults(the Sean Penn character and the end on the beach a bit long) but there are with most things in life.  Especially with inovation. I found this a true cinema experience.  Why do we go to the cinema - to see the same things over and over????  No wonder our brains rot.<br/>How David can give this three stars and Red Dog four and a half amazes me.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[4]]<br/>Okay, so I get this has a grand aim and is artistic. Was I challenged yes, but in the confused way, rather than questioning my thoughts on life. Beautiful imagery and music but boring. I agree with the 'emperor has no clothes' comment. I think the people that say it is beautiful are trying to pretend they are artistic and understanding, I bet they were bored and confused too.<br/>Either that or I'm just lacking creativity and intelligence.</p>

I planned to travel 75mins to see it but then learned it was in a tiny, four-row cinema. Hello! The movie universe was telling me something, but I refused to listen! So I got it on DVD.

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[9]]<br/>I loved the film- artistically, visually, the music was moving. It has all the elements of the human condition- love, pain, struggles, birth, death, unemployment, growing up, dysfunctional families yet love, nature, women and beauty, male and authority, joy, intense sadness........<br/>It needs to be seen a couple of times to take it all in. I found some of the dialogue a litte hard to hear- but it could be my hearing !! ?<br/><br/>Highly recommend it to others!! Any artistic person will also love it.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br/>I felt compelled to comment having watched this yesterday. A fascinating and extraordinary film but one that would no doubt polarise opinion. The digital world in reality can lead us into a transient and shallow existence. So a film of such beauty and depth but requiring patience from the viewer will naturally be confronting.<br/>Ok, maybe not a film for all, but to those who walked out after 30 minutes and then have the audacity to post a review - I award you all 5 stars...for stupidiy!</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[6]]<br/>I love malick's films and embrace his visual creativity. However, I am not sure this film worked as a whole. There are some amazing scenes, with brad Pitt superb as the father, but there are also some indulgent and alienating scenes that are unnecessary. It is obviously a very personal film for malick and the family scenes are the best because of this empathy with the boy characters. The contemplations of god and the universe do get a bit weird, however, and I like weird typically.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[1]]<br/>With Margaret and David's praise, expectations were high. I convinced my family the great cast, reviews and  storyline spelled excellent viewing.<br/>But sadly I felt like screaming in frustration as this movie kept shooting off on boring, supposedly creative spirals. I assured everyone it would improve but it didn't.<br/> I love hidden meanings, deep plots and creativity... but I prefer those 'messages' more cleverly interwoven with reality. Something subtle or suggested - not disconnected dialogue and spacey-looking visuals to show off creativity!" It was just so boringly obvious. Penn was obscure and the beach scene reminded me of Ghost Whisperer.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[8]]<br/>I was expecting the exact opposite but this film is simply INCREDIBLE!<br/>In the first 20 minuets i almost fell asleep because of the strange non- linear story and not knowing what the hell was going on. However once I started seeing the shots of the universe and then the creation of the earth and even some dinosaurs i was shocked at how amazing and profound it was.<br/>Once that section was over the main plot revolving around the family (especially the father son relationships) are pretty engaging and the cinematography is simply phenomenal (as you'd expect from mr. Malick).</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[2]]<br/>Beautifully shot, artistic, poetic, ambitious, pretentious and tedious. If you are a fan of next to no dialogue and love lots of dreamy images with whispering voices in the background then this is for you. This is really a one or five star film as you either love it or hate it ,which I'm sure Malick enjoys. You cannot deny the skill in the making of this film but for me it was an excruciating 2.5 hours that I would love back. Mainstream blockbuster lovers should stay well away and the rest approach with caution.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[6]]<br/>There was a grand and admirable vision in the theme;  however there were too many missing connections. It did hang well together and this was its downfall. On the positive, there was a sense of true beauty in the family story within and intense search individually by its younger characters.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[6]]<br/>Much better than no stars: filled with beautiful light, true nostalgia and genuine humanity. I like cosmic scenes so those didn't bore me, but weren't as daring as their model, Kubrick's 2001. The acting was very good especially the intimate scenes between boys and parents. However, 5 stars overlooks some irritating flaws: Full of cliche (Evolution=dinosaurs, family life = ad for tissues, mum=nurturing&amp;passive, dad=cold/protective...I could go on and on, like the film) its pretention is in the arty scenes that dont add to meaning and the voiceovers are v.regretable. But it got me thinking: so above average.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br/>A visual and auditory masterpiece that is evocative of the beauty and wonders of our existence. The film is undeniably ambitious and will alienate a large proportion of movie audiences. Given the majestic aims of Malick, it would be banal for him to expose the metaphysical and emotional elements in a conventional narrative.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[0]]<br/>I gave it 1 from 2000 because of Brad Pitt.  With 300 others i had a free showing. Many left by 15mins. We left with most others by 25mins.  Someone said about 20 stayed to the end in the hope it would get better.  It lacks lots apart from a conventional story line.  It lacks character and intensity and is a confusing mishmash.  Uses surrealistic out-of-focus scenes to meld a disjointed irregular potpourri of scenes for the movie. As for Margaret and David - who knows what arty illiterati are thinking. Give this a wide miss because it is junk.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[9]]<br/>This isn't a movie - it's like being dropped into a piece of art and left to your own devices to interpret it. Amazing visuals, beautiful music and compelling themes. My only criticism is the second half lapses a bit too much into a conventional format and drags on a bit, but the overall experience is mesmerising and confronting. I cried more than any movie in recent years, so it must have been good! Really wish I'd seen it in a cinema now. If you want a conventional 90 minute movie though, chose something else.</p>

Rarely, we agreed it was a monumental waste of our time and wouldn't recommend it to anyone we know. <br/>Sean Penn will want to forget his participation in this pile of poo as much as Robin Williams' would have for "Hook"!</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[5]]<br/>I loved the "evolution" scenes, but then I'm not a creationist. :) They really got across that sense of infinite expanse and infinite minutiae.<br/><br/>And in there somewhere, almost unheard, our human desire for to belong, to have meaning and relevance. Where does that desire come from, when all else seems content to just be?<br/><br/>For me, the human side of the story dragged on terribly. Once I understood we were being taken through their experiences, I wanted something to resolve. I didn't understand Sean Penn's role at all.<br/><br/>A brave and lovely film; very affecting, if not completely understood.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br/>Personally I loved this film; sure it's a little too arty for the uneducated side of society hence all the zero stars and hatred posted on this review.<br/>Malick showed a soft and delicate side of his life in this film and I think he portrayed it beautifully.<br/>My favorite scene is certainly the raw emotion showed then the child dies.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br/>Grace and Nature are presented as 'choice' at the beginning of the film.  The mother depicts one and the father, the other. Creation is depicted as a combination of both.  We are ALL part of the one cell. But it is Choice that determines our destiny or fate. The Nature of Trauma is it brings US together through Grace.<br/>This film makes basic some big questions. It provides us with an answer at the beginning of the film...  which is 'To Love'.<br/>It's hilarious that some 'choose' to get angry about the money they spent rather than try to learn something.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br/>This was a wonderful film and it really isabout  suffering and the fall from grace- and <br/>despite our ilusion of control of th world we really have very little . My favourite scene is when the father  goes on a year long trip around the world  the boys find a little lizard in the back yard and chase their mother all over the house scaring her witless . She retains her innocence and gracious nature but Jack struggles with the darker forces that would overpower him  .An Edenic themed scene .Gus Gramazio</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[2]]<br/>Why do Americans think that sentimental whispering adds emotion and feeling to a movie? It's painful! Films of sublime quality like, Lantana, The Piano, In a Better World, The Sea Inside and Jean de Forette/ Manon de source, all deserve 5 stars. This felt very amateurish. All the creationist images were disjointed and dull. Should have used Baraka or Koyanasquatsi instead. Too many billowy white linens. It felt like the director wanted an excuse to under direct.</p>

Let this film work on you - you may not like parts of it (the dinosaur sequence polarizes viewers) but it will work on you and leave you thinking for days after - not a bad thing eh? Or else, watch reality tv and feel your brain harden.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br/>Poetry in cinema. Malick is one of the first to understand the capacities of this medium in a modern sense. He uses cinema as poets use language and composers use music: to convey an experience greater than the sum of its parts. It makes me happy that someone with his vision was able to make a mainstream film like this.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[6]]<br/>I thought the acting was fantastic - Brad Pitt and the young boys and the mother and her grief.  He really could have left out the dinasours - I did nearly walk out at that point.  I think the 'nature' scenes really did go on a bit - I enjoyed them - but he needed to halve the length.  I like that someone is brave enough to produce a thought provoking movie like this rather thena spit out another Rom Com!</p>

He spends a lot of time thinking about his films. This is ambitious not pretentious. People just aren't liking it because it's different.

Brad Pitt and young Jack were alright in later scenes.<br/>And the beginning if you are going to have dialogue make it audible not whispered, and mumbled off screen. If you cant hear it what is the point.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[8]]<br/>I'm pretty unsure about this. But maybe half of people liking the film and half of people hating it was intended. Maybe the bigger picture is that there may actually be "two ways through life" Nature - bored, frustrated and Grace - liking the film? And reading some of the comments with zero stars, sounds almost like something the father character might say, and the comments with 5 stars sounds sort of like the mother finding "beauty"...maybe that's the irony...because audiences are indeed separating in two halves. I think the film asks "why are we even watching at all?"</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br/>One of my favourite movies. It seems people have become heavily programmed by typical, predictable plots and cinematography, that anything that challenges this is not tolerated. This not only challenges but makes everything else pale in comparison. Yes David, 2001, but Kubrick didn't attempt to capture the raw emotion and depict an era and societies conditioning etc., like this masterpiece. To me it seemed like a day in the life of Penn's character, daydreaming on his brothers anniversary of death, trying to find meaning and purpose in this mysterious life. Better than escapism any day of the week!</p>

What a waste of what could have been a good story - without the screensaver effects and the disjointed narrative.  On whose authority does Malick base his belief that this is how the earth was created and how we all came to be here?  The family dynamics and the acting were good - BUT!!!  A boring, confused and  pretentious (yes that word!) piece of rubbish!</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[0]]<br/>It felt like Malick was channelling Michelangelo Antonioni and his film Zabriskie Point from 1970.  The creationist footage required LSD from the 1970's to stay the distance.  A  fraudulent piece of filmmaking.  An anachronism in 2011. The audience kept nodding off and this was a matinee session.  Malick's finest film was The Thin Red Line.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[8]]<br/>While the film never completely absorbed me, I was moved and entranced, and left with a feeling of having experienced something out of the ordinary. Faith is not needed in order to go with this simple but touching tale, humans pitted against  a vast and incomprehensible universe. Who cares what it was all about? I cried and marveled at the boldness of Malick's vision.<br/>How I wish we could have seen Heath Ledger playing the father, as originally planned. Brad Pitt was excellent but this role was the sort that Ledger excelled at - a troubled, flawed, yet compelling man.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br/>Wow. Judging from all the remarks about people leaving the film early and mentions of words like "meaningless" and "pointless,"  I honestly don't begrudge people who didn't like it, I can totally understand, but walking out early? That's pretty pathetic. As for me, the film affected me emotionally unlike any other film in recent memory. The childhood scenes evoked powerful memories. The creation scenes were awe-inspiring and integral to the existential themes that the film explored.</p>

Just as it get going, we have a half-hour (seemed interminable) National Geographic special on the origin of the universe, or something.   Later there is a dinosaur sequence - this in a movie about 1950s Texas.    The audience I saw this with was struggling with the urge to bolt out of the theatre.    Didn't anyone associated with making this debacle have the guts to tell Malick (whose other films I liked) that this was a train wreck??</p>

The music and visuals work so well together. I saw it with a friend, and he said the boys were so real, it felt like you were just living life, not watching a movie. Just amazing.</p>

I left with my friend with many questions and uncertainties about the flow, the points of pivotol history, of shared experience, of nurture....<br/><br/>While a 2001 it's all full of stars eyeball refence is appropriate. So to for me is a Baraka.

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[8]]<br/>Firstly, my wife absolutely hated it. (Her exact words..."Pretentious crap")  Me? Well I can't stop thinking about it.  I think it may have been overly long and a bit ambitious (a 6 hour Directors cut? Eeek!), and whilst the 2001 comparisons are valid, 2001 was the better film in my opinion. Overall though, there is something very haunting and bewitching about it. The family scenes with the boys are brilliantly done...and it's a beautiful film to watch.

Unfortunately I did not follow those wise souls but stayed to the bitter end.<br/> I remember silently screaming to myself :  "Please end. I want to go home!" during the interminable heaven sequence.People were on a beach  just wandering around aimlessly  with vapid smiles on their faces. It looked like hell to me. Just like this movie.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[2]]<br/>((The Tree Of Life))[[2]]<br/>This film struggled with its delivery and focus on theme. Other film comparisons  which struck me, in addition to Kubrick's 2001, were Kowatskatski and Jurassic Park. Whilst vision was large,  the execution was belied by an audience which burst out laughing in some pre- history scenes. The  ending was a trite wind up of the fragmented troubles of childhood (concerning the culpability of both parents) for the protagonist. Unfortunately the film couldn't decide on it's genre and became a messy exploration of childhood angst with the promising opening themes of nature and grace distractedly side lined.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[9]]<br/>Sublime again! Second time viewing was just as amazing, inspiring and incredible - all but the dinosaurs and the beach scene which seemed a bit lacking both times. But who am I to judge the vision of this film making genius. I intend to watch everything he has made now. I feel sad for those who cannot open themselves to such a grand spiritual vision. It certainly seems to polarize the audiences. It is a weird feeling to leave the theatre (both times), feeling so elevated and moved, only to overhear the negative comments from others who felt the opposite.</p>

Just because some of us didn't like the film does not mean we didn't get it. Use of 'pretentious' hardly disqualifies one as a credible reviewer. If I couldn't use that word, what else could I say about any Peter Greenaway film?<br/><br/>"by definition all art is more or less pretentious and thus you add nothing to our understanding of the world."

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[9]]<br/>My review of this movie is further below on 15 July 2011.  My reason for commenting again is to ask why, in so many comments below in relation to  people that walked out, did husbands and wives and partners both walk out together?   When I was there I heard a gentleman behind me say to his wife and/or partner: "Are you enjoying this?' and then they both walked out.

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[1]]<br/>Wow, so many comments. At least the tree of life was a provocative enterprise.<br/>That said I think there have been much, much braver films and there have been more artfully successful films. Come to think of it, I reckon this film only provokes because it has hollywood stars in it. full stop. As far as art films go it has not an ounce of originality. And yes it IS pretentious and embarrassing to watch</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[8]]<br/>For THE TRIP that is!<br/><br/>As is often the way the supposedly lighter, more trivial, more frivolous piece of work ends up being significantly more profound. And, at least for this viewer, more moving. And contemplative...than the afore bemoaned Tree of Life-less.<br/><br/>Quality films do not grow on trees these days and however much portentous bullshit you attempt to nourish the impoverished story line  of T O L with, it's still just manure.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[6]]<br/>This film is like going to a good art exhibition, but then getting trapped in the gallery for days. It's just too long. The photography is beautiful, the acting superb, but the whole thing could have been wrapped up in a short film and still had impact. The mother never aged: the ideal beautiful mum who never did housework or looked harried, but kissed her children in slow motion. However the themes of love, parenting and sibling jealousy and hurt were well done.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[6]]<br/>It's almost as though Malick has tried to borrow elements from Space Odyssey 2001 and 400 Blows (two BRILLIANT films) but not quite hitting the mark on either attempt. It wasn't the lack of narrative that was it's undoing but rather that it felt like it was trying too hard to be something that it couldn't be. Although that can be forgiven if the film is genuinely engaging. Whilst having engaging moments evoking strong emotion, I felt all too often disconnected by the film. Having said that I can't fault the acting nor its photography.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[8]]<br/>Fascinating and extraordinary film. Like David I was not completely convinced, but like Margaret I was utterly moved. To the people who were merely bored - learn to concentrate! All great art requires effort and patience. The scene of reunion on the sand bar was surely a vision of heaven/afterlife - not something I believe in, in a literal sense, but recognise as an expression of the deepest human longing. The music was occasionally heavy-handed, but also fabulous.The dinosaurs were comical, but also beautifully real. A work of art need not be perfect in order to be great.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br/>It was an emotionally exhausting yet cathartic experience immersing myself in this textually rich, cinematographic poem about meaning of man's existence. The context is about the death of a son and a brother and it provides a natural setting to question those big questions that too many of us avoid, and ultimately puts in perspective the life of man against the immensity that is time and space. Does death negates all? Is our shared memory to be erased as if never existed?</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br/>I am deeply grateful for a work of spiritual genius that kept my feet grounded on the floor while also encouraging me to stop looking at the world through my head and to start looking at it through my HEART instead..Soooo many precious windows opened up as i watched and suddenly I was home...a place where Silence, Stillness, Peace, Clarity, Joy and Love where so real and so very enticing that i wondered why we've let our left hemisphere, ego-driven minds blind us to our true selves...Namaste Mr Malick</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br/>Terrence Malick is a cinematic genius of the highest order!<br/><br/>To those filmgoer's who walk out of a film after half an hour, you should be excluded from reviewing any film. To those of you who believe this film was a waste of your precious time, you should stick with the  85 minute popcorn rubbish that fills most of the cinemas around the country as you clearly don't have the patience to experience a wonderful piece of film art.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[5]]<br/>Yes I'm fence sitting.  This was a film that still make me analyse what I saw, had wonderful imagery, quiet moving performances.  But the confussing narrative &amp; the wispering diaolgue annoyed the hell out of me.  The one thing that did suprise me was how many people didn't walk out during the film. If you want to be challenged, go see it because I still recon there is something wonderful in it I'm still trying to discover.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[0]]<br/>Hmm - I see a lot of other people wished they'd walked out of this movie (though clearly some really loved it too). Well, after half an hour, that's exactly what i did (yes, I had an aisle seat !). And top marks for the Dendy (Newtown) - they happily let me then watch Meek's Cutoff without additional cost. But alas - I'd only give that half a star !! (my unlucky night, I guess !) - another ponderous, silent (almost) movie that just didn't do it for me.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[4]]<br/>the whole cyclopaedia of cinematic cliches has been used in this movie with the effect of boring the viewer, but the depiction of boyhood in the 1950"s was quite interesting.Discussing the movie with my wife I asked about the depictions of boyhood sexuality which she entirely missed so in order to contribute to the debate I would like to pointout the following-  the stolen nightgown was used for masturbatory purposes and had to be disposed of to both hide the event and to assuage guilt. Later, a sexual incident occurred between the two brothers which the older could not forget</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[7]]<br/>I'm with David on this one. There were moments of great beauty in this film and moments of great boredom. The scenes exploring the children at play were too long and I agree with David that the Sean Penn character was not integrated well enough. The whispered comments were sometimes difficult to hear and the dinosaurs were cute but a bit comical. Still, he's an amazing, brave director whose not afraid to address the difficult questions and challenge his audiences. You can't help but admire that.</p>

Beautiful visuals and terrific acting but far too much film of the boys playing and their mum staring into the distance. Should have been 30 minutes shorter, and rarely has there been such a hokey ending. Thought the dinosaurs showed potential though.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[8]]<br/>I can certainly understand that most people who do watch this film will detest it and how it can be plain boring. It is a challenging film. I found myself wondering what exactly is going on, what is all this leading to and how will it all end? But if you are open-minded enough to experience something unique, observe and absorb this visual presentation and philosophise the overall experience once the credits have rolled, there is a worthy reward and message waiting on the other side. I wasn't moved, I wish I was but do wish to see this again.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[6]]<br/>Some beautiful images and music in search of some worthwhile themes.<br/>Men who endured the depression and survived the war  were often excessively harsh fathers of their male children convinced that they had to" harden them up" so they could endure their lives. <br/>This familiar  theme was explored in a way which  gave me no new insights.<br/>A man who works and provides for his family but who does not achieve fame or wealth is an abject  failure. <br/>This is a frequent and deeply disturbing theme of films from the United States. Once again , no new insights.<br/><br/></p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[1]]<br/>The most exciting thing about this film was when the guy in front of us at the Nova's continual use of his iPhone stirred enough people awake to give him an torrent of invenctive. Paradoxically, even as one of those to object to his phone use, I (almost) understood how bored he was. After an hour, I was calculating what other cinema I could sneak into.<br/><br/>The dialogue, such as it was, was barely audible. As Danny Katz perfectly put it in yesterday's Age, they could have easily lopped 40, maybe 50 million  years off in the edit room.</p>

If I had to see one more shot of billowy curtains I would have puked - also brought on by the nausea of moving camera shots.  And what's with the compassionate dinosaur concept?  Oh dear.  We've seen all those Universe and volcano images before.  Sorry but I just kept thinking...What a waste of money.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[2]]<br/>Everyone sees things differently and thats the beauty of life. No one is right or wrong. For me this movie is visually stunning in parts and does a great job of capturing real and intricate human emotion, is brilliantly acted by the young boys but the narration is boring, ending weak and it drags on for an eternity. 17 people walked out of our cinema. The fella next to me fell asleep. But the highlight was watching two strangers fight over a mobile phone after one of them kept checking for footy scores and refused to turn it off!</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[1]]<br/>I went to watch this film knowing only that Margaret had given it a 5 star rating and that it would be visually stunning. Mid way through the story of creation sequence I realised I was sitting in a kabbalah propaganda film, which was certainly not subtle and (as my wife described) at its worst patronising. We both walked out of the cinema so quickly we didn't wait to see whether Madonna  (or  similar) helped finance this film, but wouldn't be surprised.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[8]]<br/>Knew nothing of this film (or Malick, really) going in last night. I left appreciating the stunning visuals but on the fence; part of me liked it, part of me wondered what exactly I'd just seen. All I know is I felt like I'd just left a great yoga session, and 24 hours later I still feel peaceful -- like something was purged. Can't explain that, can't stop thinking about it, and know I'll see it again. Save a wasted Penn and a walk on the beach I could've done without, this really moved/haunted me. Not many movies do that.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[8]]<br/>The picture of a youth who loses that inner sense of goodness must resonate with a lot of people. Also the family microcosm was so huge &amp; real and Malick's style seems perfectly suited to childhood memories (the sibling stuff was amazing). But outside of this it was a bit boring despite all the grandeur, and some of the allegorical scenes left me feeling a bit awkward for Malick and the actors. Still there is much about this movie which is excellent, 4 from me.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[8]]<br/>Alot of people are calling the film  pretentious . But I think many don't understand the meaning. For something to be pretentious it has to force  itself as better or be austintatious for the sake. I think that a film the deals with themes that required  a certain style be applied to do it justice. Obviously mallick knew that a conventional 3 act structure wouldnt convey the message he was intending. A large part of the film is about what the viewer takes from it as it is so ambiguous. But I can understand how some don't like the style.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[9]]<br/>My friend felt like walking out and a middle aged couple behind us did walk  out?  I have walked out of movies before so I was ready for anything.  But wow, I loved this film.  What a fantastic concept from the Director - brilliantly directed.  Beautiful images and a wonderful soundtrack - I have to buy the CD.  The film pulled at my emotions and feelings about life.  I was mesmerized and enthralled by it all.  And the acting from the three boys, particularly the eldest, was rivetting.  Highly, highly recommended.</p>

I'm sure it was easy for Saen Penn to have learned his lines. <br/>I'll never get the over  2 hours I endured on this back. Poor me!

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[3]]<br/>I find the radically divergent views of this film fascinating, and wonder what personality traits separate those in each faction. I saw Tree of Life last night with my partner, and found it to be one of the most yawn-inducing, over-the-top films I've ever seen. <br/><br/>I'm a philosophy major at uni, and a very spiritual person, so thematically, this movie should have appealed to someone like me. Whilst the underlying concepts for this film were notable, I found the 15 minute mish-mash of nature pics was lazy directorship, whilst the operatic score was unbearably masturbatory. Not impressed.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[4]]<br/>Without question the most meandering film since Gaspar Noe's "Enter The Void" (2009) - damn writer/directors!  The editing initially feels poetic, but ends up looking amateurish - as if the script was loose and too much footage was filmed.  Desplat's score was jarringly melodramatic, set against the subtle/vague story, which ultimately leaves no impression whatsoever.</p>

During the nature or whatever you want to call sequence one get yelled out: "well this is exciting" and walked out. That was the most interesting thing about the movie ! If they had sticked to the story of why Brad Pitt was such a bad father it could have worked as i was curious about that relationship with his children. The children were fantastic. Anyway very very odd !!! Go  but take your pillow !<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[7]]<br/>This film almost gets there doesn't it. It's brought down at times by the weight of it's own ambitions. At times the imagery and voiceovers are just too cliched. Sean Penn's character does little more than look intensely into the distance. And yet it warrants a second viewing.  Filmmaking as art without being overly hermetic.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br/>j((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br/>To me this film deplicted  many elements of the human condition and mysteries surrounding us. We live within absolute beauty of nature, which can be light and dark and everything inbetween.<br/>As human beings we are beautiful, complex and yet flawed. The landscapes in the film were like a reflection of a human emotion . I did not find it pretentious. I guess the beauty of this film is that we will all get something different out of it. Language does not always explain how we feel feel and are connected to our world.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br/>I found this a brilliant, sensitive, touching, Zen defining film. Its representation and statement of the sacred feminine energy in life and men or women was a moving interpretation of the most important, most misunderstood and most ignored message of all the great sages and spiritual leaders from Buddha and Jesus through the Dalai Lama and Thich Nhat Hanh. Brad Pitt's character very brilliantly and simply stated the limitations of man when ruled by his ego instead of his heart and soul misses the need to use life to learn how to express love on your own path.</p>

If you want profundity and to reflect on our utter insigificance in this universe, go outside at midnight and look at the Milky Way- it is much more moving.  I am all for themes, the big question/s and amazing cinematography, but if you want the accolade of "art" then you need to wrap it all in a purpose.  Narrative doesn't need to be conventional, but this move has none that i could discern.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br/>Thrilling and reaffirming to see such brilliant audacity in film. <br/><br/>This is quietly, unashamedly, unapologetically a philosophical fim - unlikely to be enjoyed by those not of a metaphysical, poetic, spiritual, or reflective bent.<br/><br/>This is film as art: visually engaging and with only the highest of purposes - reflection on the most abstract questions of human existence.<br/><br/>Mallick's vision here is truly grand - ambitious almost beyond belief. Even if it falls a little short, the result is still so much bolder, braver, and more brilliant than most else in film (or contemporary art).<br/><br/>Full stars just for trying.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[0]]<br/>Profoundly, mind-numbingly, dreadful. It would have made as much sense to watch this garbage saga in reverse. Flush away the silly birth of the universe bit, the goons on the beach sequence, the Penn looking constipated in the office and Pitt as disfunctional Dad segments and you are left with a fairly decent home-movie grade short of kids and dogs. Can somebody please keep this man away from cameras?</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[7]]<br/>I agree with David. It's possibly the most ambitious film I've ever seen.  Film is the better for this work.<br/><br/>I'd describe the pacing as organic. It really evoked for me the quality and mysteries of memory. The downside is the film turns ponderous at times. Sean Penn's role too seemed disconnected.<br/><br/>The dinosaur sequence could have been more lightly handled.<br/><br/>Having said this, it was engrossing and achingly beautiful. Pitt was nuanced as Heath Ledger's replacement, and I was left pondering some big questions.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[8]]<br/>One of those strange films where one part of me knows that I'm watching a masterpiece and is bathing in the visual poetry, and another part is so busy trying to figure it all out that I failed to connect with it as emotionally as I did with Malick's previous films. Then there was a small part that was yelling 'enough already'. The main strength of this movie is that it will stir you either negatively or into rapturous appreciation. Personally though, being a Hindu, I struggle to relate to the Christian way of dealing with death and afterlife.</p>

What a waste of time.  You'd have to be on something pretty strong to watch the first hour and think it was beautiful or amazing.  I'd rather watch a Nature documentary on TV.  As for whatever it was about, I couldn't have cared less.  What was Fiona Shaw thinking?  As for the music, over the top!!  My partner and I were not the first to walk out either.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br/>A tremendous film which explores questions which are rarely dealt with in modern film and in a beautiful and arististic way which is completely appropriate for the themes it covers.  Those themes include how the world was made, God's relationship to us, our relationship to each other and what happens to us when we die (a subject recently explored in Eastwood's Hereafter).It is a quietly reflective and thought provoking piece.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br/>A masterpiece. The fragmentary structure matches the way we recall early life experiences much better than a simple narrative. Here, at midlife, on an anniversary of his brother's death, the Penn character confronts the question that has haunted him: Why did God allow his brother to die?  With the perspective from midlife, now aided by the knowledge that man is a latecomer to the Earth, he recognises that we are not the focus of any God, and the torment is resolved. In the final scene, a mindscape, he connects his family with the present and is freed to move on.</p>

It wasn't just the cinematography - it made me think and feel in a way I haven't before in a cinema.  It's not at all conventional (my two friends both fell asleep while watching it) - and it's not for everyone - but I like that every person who sees it will take away something different from the experience.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[2]]<br/>To me The Tree of Life was a totally boring, pretentious load of crap.  My friend walked out half-way and I waited to the end, hoping for the grand finale.  People in the audience behind me muttered it was a waste of their time and money.  Another friend of mine thought it was a load of nonsense, as did other people I heard about.  Boring and confusing were common descriptions.    Mozart's Sister, on the other hand, was a lovely, though overly long, poetic piece.  Perhaps Margaret needs to retire!</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[5]]<br/>As much as I enjoyed that this film didn't have a normal narrative structure, I found it confusing and unrelatable. As I am only 22 and have never experienced Loss/ Death in my life, and grew up in an unconventional family with divorced parents from a young age, I just couldn't relate to the film at all. I think this is a film that probably can only be appreciated by an older audience. I agree with david that Sean Penns character really just isn't integrated into the film at all. I will say that it was an interesting experience though!</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[8]]<br/>You have to give Malick credit for being not just brave enough, but also credentialled and skilled eough, to be able to present such an overtly abstract film.<br/> When seen as an abstract work of art, the film makes sense in that it doesn't have to make sense. It is drawing together a whole lot of things which are vaguely connected.<br/>Instead of tieing things up in a nice neat linear bundle it dares to leave a a raft of unanswered questions, as if that is the whole point.<br/>Movies like this do not come along all that often.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[9]]<br/>This film is neither conventional or generic. It is fluid. The story line is set within the infinite and limitless boundaries of Sean Penn's characters  mind. Trying to pinpoint the exact moment on time when he lost his family and he wishes to return to them and reunite them with his brother.  The final scene on the beach is beautiful. Just brilliant... You need to open your minds also to see the simple beauty of this film.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[7]]<br/>Malick has made two films I admire greatly - The Thin Red Line and Days Of Heaven - but this one doesn't quite hang together. Watching TofL was a frustrating experience; I felt like there were two films fighting to get out. His depiction of childhood was very evocative but as David mentioned you can feel the film was tinkered with, to its detriment. Penn's role has been edited down to nothing, the Christian symbolism is heavy handed and the ending unfortunately reminded me of a cheesy British Airways commercial. Still, it's worth seeing for some flashes of poetic brilliance.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[9]]<br/>A lot of people are complaining about the film being pretentious but is that necessarily such a huge crime? Sometimes you need some pretension to get ideas across. A necessary sin, if you will.<br/>I went into it in a very passive mood with an open mind and it worked wonderfully for me. I think you need to approach as you would watching old art films.<br/>As much as I am defending that aspect of the film, sometimes Malick just went a little overboard. I hope the dinosaurs didn't make it into the directors cut.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[2]]<br/>I shall be thinking about this film for a very long time. Wondering why I chose to see it. Anxious that the whispered dialogue drowned out by the celestial choir may have been important. Uncertain if I can ever rely on Margaret's rating again. Worried that half the audience may still be asleep in the cinema. Concerned that the horsehead nebula was the only constellation I recognised. But ultimately, like the dead parrot, one star for the lovely plumage...</p>

I was nearly in tears several times during the film as I can't remember when I have seen such art on screen and been so taken away and immersed in a vision, in ideas, in moments. I thought we now lived in a world barren of boldness and guts. Where focus on money and lack of substance is just how it is now. I thought it had become impossible for any true art to survive. I feel hope</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[3]]<br/>Visually and musically astounding, and three wonderful performances from Pitt, Chastain and young McCracken, this film has a number of worthy features, but ultimately it fails because its incoherent and messy assembling lacks power or merit.<br/><br/>I walked out very disappointed, especially by the use of Penn and that last part was dreadful, as David acknowledged. The lack of narrative didn't bother me so much as the uneven nature of the scenes, the relationships were not explored enough and the meaning was lost between the cracks.<br/><br/>Hefty ambition but poor delivery.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[8]]<br/>3/5?  Hey, lighten up, let's keep the rating scale consistent, it's a tiny bit better than that.  Sure, the cosmic stuff rabbits on a bit, but Malick is always that rare director who makes his narratives work on you primarily through burnished images, not through non-visual plots and dialogues.  See it twice, and you'll notice more stuff.  And please, no more lame comparisons to Kubrick, a supreme egotist never remotely like Mailck in his approach.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[7]]<br/>I saw it 6 days ago and I am still thinking what this is about.  I get the feeling it wants to be something philosophical and probably religious.  But I also get the feeling that something is missing.  I cannot find the conection between the birth of the universe and this family's history.  There are no links between the two.  To compare this with 2001: A Space Odyssey is too much.  2001 is a masterpiece; this is not.  3.5 stars for cinematography and good intention.  Will I watch it again to fill in my gaps?  Maybe.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[8]]<br/>Loved and hated it. Its the kind of film that provokes excessive reactions - which are interesting. It may divide audiences, but the division for me was internal. There were moments of cinema in this film that are almost too beautiful. Then there are heavy cliches (cue masks floating through water, stepping through door frames). Unlike Thin Red Line - the monologues become trite and representative of one deindividualised voice. There is also a feminist critique to be made here. It has to be seen but very flawed genius. Wanted more and less at the same time.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[4]]<br/>To mention this film in the same breath as 2001: A Space Odyssey is a travesty.  2001 was one of the great landmark films.  This film attempts to emulate that feat, but fails on the grounds of obscurity and tedium.  Visually stunning, yes, but how Margaret finds her dialectic is a mystery in itself.  What a pity that Sean Penn's contribution is simply to stand around looking sad and morose. Two stars for the cinematography.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[6]]<br/>It fails. It was pretentious. The too long Creation-Bang sequence- looked like some clips from NASA/Geographic, was simplistic and did not weave well into the 'story'.  Terry have a look at 7th Seal or Fearless. 'Took years to edit'?? -give me an afternoon and some scissors. The story was well acted and did evoke family life pretty well, but a bit incoherent, as was the whole thing. I couldnt hear well  some of the dialogue or the 'voices from above'.  I thought for a while the older brother died but the guitar and dark hair and scowl helped. Disappointing.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[9]]<br/>This is cinema as pesonal as it gets. It's the most ambitious film since 2001:A SPACE ODYSSEY. The imagery between nature and man is filled with religious meaning. The birth of the universe and Earth surpasses what Kubrick did in the opening of 2001. This film will probaly split people within two groups. One group would call it an uncompromising masterpiece while the second group will dismiss it as pretensious. This film is constructed with fragmentary flashes of imagery and memories with a non-linear structure which for me is a sign of great piece of art.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[4]]<br/>While visually stunning and perhaps, not unlike Baraka with some of its sequences, Malikc's Tree of Life treats its audience like a fawning congregation in need of a good preach.  I wasn't moved, and found it incredibly tedious. It felt like Malick was dealing with issues of mortality and dysfunctional family life. That's fine, but the simplistic notion behind his warren-like narrative simply revisited the old theme of insecurities around fear of insignificance. As the credits rolled I heard a man behind me whisper, "What a wanker!" Perhaps not the words I would've used, but the sentiment was about right.</p>

The narrative is revealed through memories of family life of sights, sounds, love, hate, pain, jealously and set against the Universe. An experience which will leave those looking for a linear conventional narrative at a loss. An exploration of god v nature that leaves any answers up to the viewer. I'm not qualified to utter words like masterpiece, who is? but this is a film that will divide audiences and resonate with me for a long time.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[8]]<br/>Margaret hits the nail on the head re accusations of pretention. Films such as Sucker Punch are woefully pretentious. The Tree of Life is ambitious in the same vein of cinematic greats such as Tarkovsky and Bergman. It is very rare to see cinema such as this outside of film festival circuit.

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[1]]<br/>Forget about being pretentious, this film is simply not engaging in any way.  Several people left early on, presumably to take up Palace Cinema's offer of a refund - they were the lucky ones.  We decided to stay and sit through over two hours of disjointed ramblings on the American family unit and it's relationship to the greater universe.  By no means am I claiming to fully understand what this film was about, however I do know that I was bored to tears.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[10]]<br/>I was absolutely amazed by this film! Of course, visually it is exquisitely beautiful, but  more jawdropping even than the cinematography, is the film's compellingly raw portrayal of the human search for meaning. I feel like I rarely see this kind of bravery in films. The questions are framed in the context of loss and are never answered, and yet the film manages to leave you feeling uplifted. Perhaps, it is because the questions we feel foolish asking are being acknowledged by Mallick. They are the questions neither religion nor science can fully satisfy, but art can.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Tree Of Life))[[6]]<br/>I really liked this film but it's length and somewhat confusing ending left me unable to like it as much as I wanted to. Malick conveyed not a story but rather the emotion torment of Penn's character exceptionally well. It really was amazing but it was just far too long. I feel he could have cut about at least 40minutes and it would still be as good.</p>

To the shrill woman at the Nova Cinema who, as the end credits rolled announced to her friends (as loudly as possible) 'What a pretentious piece of navel-gazing - I wonder what Margaret thought of it?'  <br/><br/>Well, you have your answer.
