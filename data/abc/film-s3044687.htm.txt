<h2>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1</h2>
<p class="ratd"> Rated <em>M</em></p>
<p><em>Review by David Stratton</em></p>
<p>Harry, DANIEL RADCLIFFE, Hermione, EMMA WATSON and Ron, RUPERT GRINT, have left the relative safety of Hogwarts after the death of Dumbledore. Aware that he's being hunted down by Voldemort (the wonderful Ralph Fiennes) and the Death Eaters, Harry must go into hiding, helped by his friends. After a wedding is attacked by the Death Eaters, the trio head for the hills on a quest to locate and destroy the Horcruxes, which (the synopsis tells us) are the keys to Voldemort's immortality.<br/><br/>This series is really getting tired. The films of J.K. Rowling's mega-popular books were always handled with grim seriousness by the various directors assigned to them, but at least in the early films there was a sense of magic and originality. That's gone now that the heroic trio are out in the real world. The only reason for splitting the final film in two (you'll have to wait till July for Part 2) seems to be money: screenwriter Steve Kloves could easily have pruned the leaden-paced screenplay and cut to the chase. <br/><br/>Apart from the instantly notorious moment in which Ron sees Hermione and Harry in a naked embrace (it's all in the mind, you know), there are few startling moments in the film, though little kids will get nightmares from the snake, which behaves as if it's still in the abandoned 3D version. Potter aficionados probably know exactly what's going on, but the primitive exposition left me all at sea and half the time I didn't know what on earth they were talking about. <br/><br/>There are some good moments, and the British landscapes on view are certainly spectacular, but whatever interest the early films had has been diminished by now. <br/><br/>And what a waste of so many fine British actors in often piffling blink-and-you'll-miss-them supporting roles!</p>
<h2>Further comments</h2>
<p>MARGARET: Yes, it's quite a roll call of royalty, isn't it?<br/><br/>DAVID: It is.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Yes, you notice them. Look, that was my first impression of this film. Why is this part one? It is so - camping out scenes forever. Long, soulful looks forever. <br/><br/>DAVID: Yes.<br/><br/>MARGARET: And you do look at it and think this is greed on wheel. You know, it should have been possible to make one final grand film of those books.<br/><br/>DAVID: Well, when you think that allegedly the longest of the books was turned into the shortest of the films, it can be done and it could have been done, I'm sure.<br/><br/>MARGARET: It's sort of like - it's pretty obvious why they've done it and the film suffers as a result. I think there are good things about it. I think the special effects - the visual effects are really first rate.<br/><br/>DAVID: But, I'm not sure they're as good as they were the first time around. You remember the first time we went into Hogwarts and all the paintings on the walls were moving and all that sort of thing.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Well, I know. <br/><br/>DAVID: There was a sort of sense of magic there.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Well, it's not fresh anymore.<br/><br/>DAVID: Well, that's right.<br/><br/>MARGARET: That's the trouble. I think Ralph Fiennes makeup is fantastic.<br/><br/>DAVID: Wonderful, yes.<br/><br/>MARGARET: I'm not wildly impressed with the performances. I don't know these kids seem to have been locked in these stereotypes for too long.<br/><br/>DAVID: Well, exactly. <br/><br/>MARGARET: And there's not room for them to want more.<br/><br/>DAVID: Yes. <br/><br/>MARGARET: But I think, actually, fans of the book will love the film and I think that's what we haven't done. I haven't read the book. I'm sure if I had I'd understand what was going on but I'm like you. I'm going, "Hello, what are all these things happening?" I'm giving it three stars for all the people who have read the books and are going to enjoy the film.<br/><br/>DAVID: Well, I'm giving it two and a half for the same people, because I think they're being a bit dudded.</p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[10]]<br>I think that the major thing for reviewers to remember about this film is that the target audience wasn't the critics. Rather, the HP film franchise has always catered more to the fans. As an interpretation of "Deathly Hallows" (incidentally my favourite out of the series), it shines. There have been many complaints from critics about the "sagging" middle and the split. Even though I am a Potter fan, I wholeheartedly support the split. David and Margaret haven't read the books and therefore can't quite understand what a monstrosity it is, story-wise. It would have been terrible as one movie.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[7]]<br>I thought this movie was a bit boring, it did tend to drag on a little although this movie had a bit of everything in it from romance to action. All the characters in this movie were fantastic and played their roles extremely well. Overall I thought this movie was pretty good.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[9]]<br>I believe that it isn't a money grabbing movie because this is what it was like in the book, it was slow at times it was dull and you would get lost but thats why the second part is so good because you have to have the boring slow parts to lead up to the finale. its not the movies fault for having to show the leadup. i recommend reading the book for anyone who didn't like the movie.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[9]]<br>we thought the movie was great but Daniel Radcliffe is very awkward  during the movie. The movie was quite good keeping up the plot. We found that having the Part 1 was more, enjoyable and it was a cliff hanger which we though was good because we wanted to see Part 2 even more.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[6]]<br>I thought the characters in this movie were great. Daniel Radcliffe gets unfair treatment at times but I think he's been great in all the films. I'm a big HP fan but I just found this movie a bit dull which is probably because the first part of the book was a bit dull. Another disappointment was that all the other great supporting actors were basically unsighted, Still a pretty good movie though.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[6]]<br>Boring!  But I can't blame the movie. This was the worst part of the final book. It drags on and on in the novel with them wandering around the countryside and it's the same in the movie. This should have been one movie and this part quickly scanned over. All the other movies are far better.</br></p>

They needed part one to show character development and the plot line. Without two parts i believe the movie would have felt rushed and incomplete.</br></p>

I think that you must of had stuck with these characters and of had read the books to understand what an amazing and brilliant movie this really is! I think both of you have misjudged this movie. If you disagree with the story line at all, then you can't blame the movie!</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[10]]<br>Fantastic movie all round! I'm a big Harry Potter fan and as a reader of alll the novels (I've bought most of them the day they've come out) I knew  what was going to happen, this made the movie a little better probably. I disagree with margrets and davids review because I really think this movie is special! <br>I went to part 2 last night and it turns out I'm actually glad they split it into two it meant more time for the story to play out! <br>Go see the whole series if you haven't already seen it!!!</br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[8]]<br>I am a Harry Potter fan and have read all the books, and have been satisfied by most of the movies. This one has been a turn for the better in comparison to Half Blood Prince, which I can't stand because nothing happened and it actually got really boring... and thats coming from someone who read the book. I know Yates can direct a good HP film because of the 5th film, which I quite liked. This one restored my faith in him that he can actually pull off a excellent Part 2, and finish the series on a high.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[8]]<br>As has always been the case as the Harry Potter series has progressed, the line between screen entertainment and staying true to J.K. Rowling's novel would have been difficult to determine in this movie. I thought it worked well in providing an experience that both drew in and made sense to those who have not read the books, and also doing justice to the book - trying to fit all of the events that occurred in would have been impossible given the available screen time.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[8]]<br>I just saw Deathly hallows part 1 on dvd, after staying away from the cinema release because of underwhelming reviews. However I have to say I thought it was really good and brought a new, more adult dimension to the films. There is a loneliness and desolation that infuses the film, and it goes beyond the usual rollicking adventure where everything is alright in the end. <br>I thought the performances of the 3 leads had a depth and subtlety that has been absent before -  they were impressive.</br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[6]]<br>I am going to be blatantly honest! For most of the 146 minutes, I was at a loss to know what was going on. I could follow the base storyline but certainly was wondering why it was to take 146 minutes to explain it. I blamed myself for this initially, for not watching the previous Potter film for a second time to freshen my memory. But after reading this review, I am more inclined to agree with David &amp; Margaret! I still watched Harry Potter 7 with interest and am giving it 3 stars for visually, it is very good.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[5]]<br>Despite being part 1 (of what should have been one whole movie), it still goes for 2 and a half hours which is half an hour too long. There was a lot that could have been trimmed (too much sitting in the woods). Bike chase and escape from the ministry were standout scenes. The whole "part one" concept also makes most of Half-Blood Prince elements redundant. Should have been, one fast-passed edge of your seat, chase movie, instead its too slow and repetitive.</br></p>

And what was happening was for the most part, plain boring.  The first movies were truly magical with the different things happening.  They were pure fun flicks.  But then, with no explanation, the ghosts disappeared, then most of the moving pictures, etc., etc.  Yep, the brit writer sure fell flat on this one!  Such a shame and a waste of my hard earned money for the ticket.</br></p>

You have to be a devoted fan who knows the story really well to understand the goings-on. A good adaptation shouldn't be like that.<br><br>Major pacing problems: rushing through at supersonic speed when things need to be explained and characters introduced; then painfully slow with unnatural pauses and lingering looks. <br><br>Hermione's expression is so permanently set in a frown that she'll be needing botox soon. There's no need to deliver every line with such gloom - she's not in Twilight!</br></br></br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[8]]<br> Saw HP with my 2 teenagers and we all enjoyed it.  The trouble with all the other films is that they miss out on so much of the details from the novels - that's why they can be hard to follow if you just see the film. I'm glad the last installment has been split in two for that reason. It is more serious and dark - in keeping with the the audience growing up and being able to understand it.</br></p>

Being a 2 instalment film could have allowed the script and screenplay to align far more with the book. Considering it is about the deathly hallows, it fails horribly to involve 1 crucially important item and how often it is used in the book. The films since number 3-4 onwards, have become so far detached from the original book story, they struggle to be remain connected in a series. Quite dissapointing really, they messed it up again with too much teen angst , tanty's &amp; hormones.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[8]]<br>I went to see harry potter and the deathley hallows part 1 on the opening weekend. Like most people I have read the book and I love the story. Sure some scenes were a bit reapative but overall it is your time and money well spent. It is sad to see that the greatest film franchise of all time is coming to an end, but we see in this final film how much these kids have grown up. I think its the best harry potter movie yet, it follows the book sophisticatley well.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[6]]<br>Harry Potter is what it is. Yes, money making was a factor in spliting the film into two, but the film was essentially made for its fanbase who will be somewhat content with the final product. Fans of the book had detested the longest book being the shortest film. <br><br>As a movie, obviously its not high art. The acting, directing and editing is spotty in parts but there are some decent cenematic scenes. Just because David and Margaret don't understand the whole plot does not make it tiresome. This movie was made for HP fans, not critics.</br></br></br></p>

With the quality and calibre of acting available the end result was disappointing, as many of these quality actors just seemed to show up to collect their cheques.</br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[6]]<br>This movie is just like the book and long and drawn out with lots of sitting around in tents talking rather than acting and having action. As for teen angst I don't really need it in a fantasy/action movie I can get that in another movie. Action when it came was good. The animation about the Deathly Hallows was probably the best part. However, I did think it better than the Half Blood Prince so thats something</br></p>

I think so. Of course they'll keep rating 'arty' films 5 stars whether or not they're any good, in hope that it will make them look cultural. It doesn't.

It stayed true to the book which would have made purists of the series happy (myself included :) ). <br>Can't wait for the last half when all that was left unsaid in the first part will be revealed!</br></br></br></p>

Really it was all about getting through the narrative for the big climax of the final moive. What I did notice more though was the use of Nazi metaphors which wasn't as apparent in the previous films.</br></p>

This series had a real magic about it, and I felt this this magic really reached its best in Goblet of Fire and Order of The Pheonix but for me, a reader of HP, Half Blood Prince was a real disappointment. I didn't find Deathly Hallows the best ending for the series in the books, but it was okay. They have done this movie more faithfully than to the others, but I just felt there was really something from this. Hopefully Part2 will be a better ending</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[8]]<br>This is the best Potter film since Prisoner of Azkaban. It is a work of art, with beautiful images both real and CGI, and an engrossing story. The animation sequence is sublime. The acting is altogether great however some of the deaths are treated inconsequentially. Both the score and the pacing are just right and there's quite a lot of humour despite the subject matter. Bring on Part 2!</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[4]]<br>Painfully boring, i've enjoyed a few of the other harry potter films, but this was so boring. It didnt have the magical quality of some of the others and i found myself wondering a bit about what the hell was going on. Not a terrible movie, but i didnt find it enjoyable at all, and it really draaaaagggged on for me.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[8]]<br>I'm not a huge Potter fan but I really enjoyed this more than almost all of the other Potter movies. I think the fact that it wasn't end to end action and had a slower flow made it far more enjoyable. The landscape shots were beautiful. I thought the build up of malevolence and uneasiness as they all realise things are about to reach a climax really set the scene for the last one.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[7]]<br>The movie is true to the book, the sense of directionless travel also present in the novel. It conveys well those first feelings of adult responsibility and the absence of a guided path. <br>These are teenaged characters and the actors portray the angst and frustration well.<br>I fear that my icons David and Margaret may have declined to read this phenomenal series of books simply because everyone else has. Please don't separate yourselves too far from the rest of us!</br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[9]]<br>Harry Potter 7, Part 1, is the greatest interpretation of the books so far! action! scares! mystery! it's plain perfection! the music is incredible, the effects are up to date, and the acting (especially Lord Voldemort's) is perfect! The ending (not exactly a cliffhanger) makes you want more! Although anyone who has NOT read the 7th book wouldn't understand as much i don't think.</br></p>

It's long and boring, and the story is as muddled (sorry) as it was in the book.  I had hoped the script writers would've fixed the flaws to make it more sensible.  Alas, it's riddled with problems.  I never understood why the three run from the snatchers, when they have magic.  The producers decision to split the story into two films is typically an insult.  Booo</br></br></p>

I love all the other HPs but this one was just boring, dull and far too long. I don't want to sit in a theatre for close to 3 hours watching 3 moody teens mope around, stare off into the distance and carry on every now and then. The more 'action' parts were fine, so obviously if they had of cut out the moody crap I described above, the movie would have been much more exciting and interesting. Very disappointing!</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[4]]<br>Dull dull dull. First 15 mins got off to a cracking start and then director Yates cheerily decided to drive this leaden, soupy dirge into a ditch. It seems as though he became self-conscious and intimidated by the legacy of what had gone before it and reverted to stodge. There was actually a good story in there but it needed more close-ups, mid-shots and faster cutting, with the actors pushed a little more in the forest sequences at times instead of this willowy, bland sludge. A disappointing flat note with which to end what was once such a fantastic series.</br></p>

I went to the midnight screening with my fanatic friends. <br><br/>Visually it's stunning and the animation sequence on the deathly hallows is amazing. I didnt find that the film dragged on, sure some of the tent scenes were a little dull but action of others/ effects made up for this. The trios acting has definitely improved, and  as expected the big names are fantastic . It sets up the climax of part 2 very thoroughly. look forward to p2</br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[10]]<br/>Deathly hallows is far and above the best movie of the series. The trios performances have greatly improved, especially Watsons. I enjoyed the focus toward both the quest and the budding relationships.<br/>While i understand the critique of the movie as a separate entity, i feel that it can't  be fully appreciated as a film without knowledge of the books.<br/>Also the harsh judgement of splitting the film is unwarranted. Without reading the books you cant possibly understand the NECESSITY of having two films, frankly one movie would have been a supreme let down.<br/><br/>CAN NOT WAIT FOR PART 2. <br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[10]]<br/>This is the closest to the book of any of the movies &amp; this was a wonderful surprise.  So much of the book story arcs were left out of previous movies, but it worked as these were lighter storylines. Of course the innocence has gone. The characters have matured and facing danger - I mean, everyone is trying to kill them!  It could have been a little shorter with some 'tent' scenes dragging but there's no way it could have been made into just one movie - it wouldn't have been fair to the fans. Some great comedy too:)</p>

The movie does a nice job of setting the scene for the finale. <br/><br/>It would be very sad indeed if we were still watching the same movies produced at the beginning of the series. It has been very enjoyable to watch the characters develop and change. Deathly Hallows P1 is part of that progression. <br/><br/>If you weren't a Harry Potter fan to begin with, this movie is not for you. I can't wait for the next installment.!</p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[8]]<br/>Deathly hallows is my favourite film to date. I was expecting to be disappointed after the fifth and six films were ... Pretty poor and missing too much detail. But I thought Rupert and Emma's acting had greatly improved.  I loved that it remained so faithful to the book, but still added a few scenes adapted for the movie. The opening seen when hermione obliviated her parents memory, for instance, (which was only mentioned in the book) was very moving. Great film suited to an older hp audience</p>

What frustrated me more was the lack of story washed over. I get we have our three hero's, but the deaths of Nighy's character and Mad-Eye are less than nothing and the Dursley's, Snape, Neville, the Weasleys and the Malfoy's stories are told with such carelesness and by unsympathetic means that none of it counts for much. Cudos to Radcliffe, Grint and Watson, though.</p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[7]]<br/>I can see why the split has been made. Quite a bit of backstory was cut from films 3-6, which will be needed to make the final film work. So, yes, it's a long book, but it has also inherited a lot of exposition. The last film will no doubt be moving at top speed all the way. I loved the film, but unless you've seen films five and six very recently, I can see how a viewer could become lost.</p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[8]]<br/>I am a fan of the book and I think that David Yates and the other Warner Bros. people have done a good job on adapting the book. The movie was quite faithful to the book (more faithful than Half Blood Prince), although I did spot several differences. I would have liked those things to be in the movie as well. For example, in the book they find out that the sword of Griffoendor can destroy Horcruxes through Phinneas Nigellus (a former Hogwarts headmaster), however, in the film Hermoine just suddenly realises that it can destroy Horcruxes which seemed unrealistic.</p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[5]]<br/>I am neither child nor teenager yet I have been a HP fan and have read all the books. Sadly, the last book is so drawn out and interminable (though not the longest in the series) that I had lost interest by the end. The movie is faithful to the book - similarly heavy-going. Verbatim regurgitation does not necessarily make a good film. Many movies are adaptations of books but they have to stand on their own cinematic feet. M&amp;D admit they have not read the book, but they are entitled to critque the movie, as a piece of cinema.</p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[6]]<br/>I'm 50/50 with the review - my biggest contention is that the splitting of the films is a money grab. There is no possible way they could have done a *faithful* adaption of the last book in one film and have captured all the necessary points. Sure this film felt padded but even with a trim it'd be enough for a first half. The tent scenes did drag a little but I understood the aim and won't fault for aiming at more character based moments. Also there's definitely still a big sense of magic, it's just a lot more serious.</p>

I have read the books, and I don't think that splitting the last one into two is purely about money....there is a lot of detail to cover. I agree that Daniel and Emma are not the best actors...<br/>As for leaving the earlier magic behind...well, Margaret and David, you really must read the books. It's like wishing Cinderella is only about the ball, all bright and tinselly, ...The books progress and become darker, more about the struggle against the evil forces, and so do the films.</p>

As usual, films of great books always disappoint, because they are mere precis.<br/>Movies are made to make money, David, and this film should be in 6 parts rather than two.<br/>Screenplay writers think they can shorten and improve books,  but it never works. Witness the farce of Lord of the Rings. The screenplay is JK Rowlings prose. Make that your movie. If it takes ten hours, good! Film making is a very flawed artform. Made for the lowest common denominator.</p>

So many things happened out of the blue if you hadn't read the books because so much important stuff has been cut out of the other movies. They were trying to jam a ton of information previously unheard of into it and my friend who hadn't read the book had to keep asking everyone else what was happening.</p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[8]]<br/>This is definitely the best Potter film yet. After the last two disappointing films, I was keen to see Yates etc. redeem themselves and they really did: this latest installment is very different to all the other films, due mostly to the fact that the trio are no longer at Hogwarts and also the more mature filmmaking. Also it was fantastic that the film stayed very faithful to the book because the past films were ruined by the lack of certain plot points from the books. Certain scenes were AMAZING. Brilliant film. Dying to see it again!</p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[9]]<br/>I disliked the previous movies.  I was frustrated by all the important details they'd left out.  I didn't see how anyone who hadn't read the books would be able to appreciate the storyline.  HPDH, however, was a pleasue to watch.  Yes, it droned on a little, but so did the characters' journey.  This is how the author intended for it to be.  So for those who didn't understand, remember, it wasn't produced soley for those who couldn't be bothered reading the books.  Those who read the series deserve to be entertained also.</p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[2]]<br/>Although the beginning was promising I found this to be a very unengaging film.  I think the main problem was a poor script - the film rambled along, mostly omitting explanation or logic in how events transpired (for instance at one point Harry and co are under attack from the all-powerful baddies inside a house in a clearing and then suddenly they are safe and well in a forest.  This film serves as a playing out of some of the action for those who have read the book - not a good film, one star for the special effects.</p>

I don't generally give much credence to critics, &amp; in this case, don't know why M&amp;D bothered at all.  I don't agree with the pretty shallow comments about money being the motivator, ie, easy to see that because M&amp;D haven't read the books, they don't get that so much important action &amp; detail would have been lost in only 1 movie. The magic expected in keeping with darkening of plot is there. Well done, can't wait for the final instalment.</p>

I honestly enjoyed the Harry Potter movies except the Half Blood Prince but the Deathly Hallows went a bit too dark, the plot was confusing for non readers but at least the great thing about it was one scene that was animated with a sepia tone. But to call fans a bit dodded is ignorant and dumb as the Harry Potter movies are strictly for fans.</p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[8]]<br/>I really wish people would stop expecting greater versions of the earlier films.  The fact is simple:- those books/films hads a strong sense of innocence and childlike wonderment, because that was what they were about.  But now the characters are older, more experienced and they have a task at hand.  It would've been truly unrealistic and therefore unengaging if the trio spent their time being amazed at the moving paintings in Hogwarts etc. <br/>These kids have grown up, right in front of us.  Hello? Harry has to defeat the greatest dark wizard of alltime, <br/></p>

Dancing with Hermione (not in the book) was a clever way to break up this experience for the writers, because it again shows Harry's true power - love.  Daniel Radcliffe has done an excellent job, and I think all other performances have improved in this film too.  <br/>I'm not saying you have to read the books to enjoy this film, but you certainly have to allow yourself to grow up with the films like we have grown up with the books.  <br/></p>

Unlike the last HP film, the humor didn't come off as forced, and this film captured the dark elements of the book perfectly! I personally had no problem with the pace of the movie- I do agree though, that people who haven't read the books may find some scenes rather tedious. But if you're a fan of the books, it's a pretty great movie!</p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[5]]<br/>Considering the sheer magnitude of the 7th book, it seemed only just (for the fans) that the Deathly Hallows be split into 2. However, as a fan of both the films and the books, I feel as though Part I wasted the opportunity to end the series neatly. While a lot of the scenes on the road were beautifully shot, they seemed tedious, considering the amount of information that was left out. Definitely not a film for people who haven't read the books - there is also a lot of assumed knowledge that hadn't been addressed in previous films.</p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[9]]<br/>I thought this was a wonderful adaptation of the novel and agree with most of the comments here.  It was the first Harry Potter movie I have seen that has really fleshed out the characters and the shift into the countryside and away from Hogwarts allowed the inner world of the characters to dominate the film. I usually love David's reviews and I think this one was really lazy and disappointing. David and Margaret almost could do with a guest reviewer under the age of 35 for such reviews.  Clearly out of touch.</p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[10]]<br/>It really does help if you have read the books.  Thg travelling -is- important to the story.  There is more to come in the second half.  There is no way they could have put this all into one movie.  They would have had to leave out either the Deathly Hallows  or the Horcruxes .  Of course it doesn't have the same magical feel. They are on the run in the real world this time.  They aren't in Hogwarts and their lives are at risk. I saw it 3 times on opening day. Enjoyed every viewing equally.</p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[5]]<br/>The Deathly Hallows book is by far the most complex of the Harry Potter series and the movie,  with lots of dialogue bits, which could have been edited - it is plot and story, not words, which carry any movie most. And this was just half a movie and it does not work with just half that super-complex story and a plot getting lost. Seeing this installment I understood why I like the others so much. They were complete. My advice is if you want to get into this movie and you have not read the book - good LUCK!</p>

Watching the clips from above is more than enough for me. I thought a couple of them were kinda fun, but this whole phenomena is really about people's regression and escapism, and certainly not about quality film-making.

I've noticed as the series has progressed it has become increasingly less approachable if you haven't either read the books or at least have seen the rest of the films. <br/><br/>As for me, who was worried. I got exactly what I wanted. Yes its overblown, overlong, but who cares? It's very faithful and I like how dark it is. Bring on part 2.</p>

Plus the most interesting parts are in the second part. Best so far. By the way Lawrence I disagree the movie wasn't bought out for those people it was bought out for hard-core fans who like me have been waiting for this for what feels like forever.</p>

They GOT IT, understood the books, the growth of the characters, and the purpose of two movies. Yes it's dark, slow, and scary.

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[8]]<br/>Even though it is in two parts, they still had to get rid of a lot of things. So many things happen in the book and because it is the last one they have to show most of it otherwise the people who don't read books won't understand it. The tent scenes were important and many of them were cut out too. I wish they would actually read the books before saying it was too long when they don't know what will happen in part two and which parts are necessary for it to make sense. The movie was wonderful.</p>

Glad i didnt take the younger kids though as this movie is much darker and has a sense of doom throughout. I didnt have any trouble following the film but then Ive read all the books so that probably helped. Not as many laughing moments in this one, though as always Ron made me chuckle more than once. Looking forward to the next one though i hated the way the last book finished up.</p>

As a fan of the books and the films this latest film was extremely satisfying. Although i'm sure money was an important factor for the splitting of the book i also believe it has enabled greater detail for the loyal Potter followers. <br/><br/>If you didn't read the books and have only seen some of the films, please don't see this one. But to all the potter fans grab a choc top and enjoy the greatness that is this movie.<br/><br/>Harry's dancing is definitely a highlight.</p>

I have never read the books however, fell madly, deeply in love with Alfonso Cuaron's magic in The Prisoner of Azkaban. I just watched Deathly Hallows and am quite proud to say I could not rise to my feet till the end of the credits. It is AMAZING! Go see it!</p>

The movie was excellent as usual. It is a pleasure to have seen the characters grow up on screen and I can't wait for part 2 of 'The Deathly Hallows.<br/>I don't know what David's problem is but he clearly needs to read the books before giving another waffling opinion. Personally I found his criticism dragging and ill-informed.</p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[9]]<br/>Yes it does help to read the book and to have seen the previous movies however this is not required to understand and enjoy what really is a spectacular film. Radcliff's acting did fall short at times but the others carried the film well, particularly Watson. I think what some call the "boredom" of the movie is in fact an honest portrayal of their directionless state at the time, no spectacular ideas or things to say, just a determination to keep going, burdened with a irresponsibility. There are some poignant moments in this film (the dance)...not to be forgotten.</p>

I thought the tent scenes slowed the pace somewhat but was then surprised when the movie seemed to end so soon, even though it was 2.5 hours long! I wanted it to continue and conclude the story. Much more enjoyable than HP6. I can't wait for the final film. Hurry up, July 2011!!</p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[10]]<br/>In my opinion, this is the best movie of the franchise. I don't believe one can truly critique they have not read the books. If you want to get more out of the movies, read the books. <br/><br/>This movie is approximately 2/3 of the book, and it still cut to the chase considerably. Also, people complaining about the loss of "magic". Magic is used all the time in the movies, however it is much darker now; it is their world.

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[8]]<br/>Thank goodness it was better than the last one!  <br/>Beginning was great, but yes, I felt myself shifting in my seat at times from boredom.  It's a shame that the magic used at this stage of the story is more violent and less "enchanting"  'cause I missed seeing great scenes, like the 'Wesley's shop".  Because of this it felt more like a twilight film- scenery, music and sexual tension.  I still loved it though and looking forward to the last half.</p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[5]]<br/>I have to agree with David. As a massive fan of the books it was missing the magic and wonder that the first few movies had. It was too focused on the big name actors they brought in and not enough on the actual story.<br/>I do think it should still be two movies but they had so much more to work with. They could have made so much more.</p>

They have admitted to not reading the final book, and everyone who has will know it is IMPOSSIBLE to fit the story into one film. Message to David and Margaret: Get your facts straight, and stop being so judgmental. You have disappointed many fans of the series by this review, but then again you are just to so called ' movie critics'  who know NOTHING about this story.</p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[9]]<br/>I also thought this was the best Harry movie yet - definitely the most well-made adaptation and the truest to the book.  I'm glad they split the movies up and did the final book justice (I didn't feel the movie 'dragged on' at all, in fact quite the opposite).  I saw the movie with someone who hasn't read the books but has seen the movies and she also enjoyed it (and was able to understand what was going on), however I think it is probably much more enjoyable for those who have read and loved the books.</p>

It's just that simply not enough "story-wise" happens in this film to be worthy of the "First half of the last book" eg: the horcrux "discoveries". It feels like it's the "first third". Honestly, I think they should have continued further into the book before finishing.<br/><br/>And BTW, reading the books will not give you magical powers or prestige. Stop acting like it does.</p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[7]]<br/>After such a disappointing HP6 I really wasn't expecting much for this one. <br/><br/>So I was pleasantly surprised with the end result for this movie. The level of detail in the books has always left the story feeling superficial; and hasn't helped Daniel Radcliffe. He's not the greatest actor, so having to portray the complex emotions in a character when the book has been denuded to fit a movie, has been beyond him in the past. <br/><br/>With this book, I believe we are getting a more enjoyable performance and experience. And that's kinda the point, right? <br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[9]]<br/>This is not meant to be an action film. It's about the three of them, their relationship and trying to stay united in the face of unknowns with little communication with the outside world. If you care about the series then you care about the characters and you will love this film. It's funny, all of the negative reviews from critics are because the film stayed too true to the book, claiming it's all about money. The movie takes the time to explore the emotions of the characters and the situation they are in, like the book. Crap review guys!</p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[5]]<br/>The scariest experience today was not the actual movie, but dreading to go see it. The last one, Harry Potter 6, was the pinnacle of mental torture. The boredom I suffered from that movie was amazing. So I was nervous to go see this movie, hoping it wouldn't be too bad. It's actually not too bad, but it is frequently tiresome, sorta boring and lacks magic and thrills. The problem is, someone must've thought it would be a good idea to copy the book scene-for-scene. That's bad writing. Movies should have pace and energy - this movie stumbles along tediously.</p>

The acting by the three main cast was as usual a bit annoying, particularly Radcliffe who has kinda ruined Harry for me.The best part was that it didn't feel to short like the more recent movies have - and hopefully it sets up for a good part 2.</p>

David and Margaret are reviewing the film from the perspective of film goers; Harry Potter isn't so special a franchise that reading an entire series of novels should be a prerequisite for understanding the film adaptation. A film should be able to stand on its own two legs without having to read the darn book beforehand.</p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[8]]<br/>All in all I wasn't expecting a film to do complete justice to the beautiful world JKR had created, but have to say that I am pleasantly surprised. Though the Horcrux-embrace can be done with a bit maturity, the film aptly captured the gloom, the pain &amp; above all the helplessness, like the dance or the graveyard scene.<br/><br/>David &amp; Margaret, don't you think this type of good cop-bad cop movie review itself is "really getting tired"? &amp; by all means please don't give away stars for all the "dudders" like us. We're well capable of awarding them ourselves.</p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[5]]<br/>Excellent review from David &amp; Margaret.  It had a promising opening with action, colourful characters and pace but then devolved into something akin to Twilight meets Harry Potter. I've read all the books but only the most loyal Harry Potter fans could argue that this movie didn't drag. The energy in a packed theatre went from 'buzz' to just simply 'zzz' as the hours past and there was an audible groan when it awkwardly ended. This is a movie for the Potter fans.  Some fine performances from the cast however considering the painfully beige dialgue they had to work with.</p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[10]]<br/>You can hardly review a film based so thouroughly on a book without reading said book. Harry Potter fans, like myself, are probably all in agreement that the movie was amazing and awesome!!!!! I also think that splitting the movie was a brilliant idea, that way they could keep true to the book and that way Harry Potter still has a good 8 months until the movies are well and truly over!! HARRY POTTER FTW! CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE! :D</p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[9]]<br/>I agree with these comments, and also feel ripped off that I can only write 100 words for my own response. The films have been unintelligible for non-book readers since 'The Prisoner of Azkaban' but this does not makes them unsuccessful films - they're for the book fans. Having grown up with Harry (I read the first at age 12 and the last at 21) The film satisfied me in every way and by far surpassed the filmic handling of some of the other books (Such as 'the half blood prince') . My suggestion: read the book, or keep quiet.</p>

Though I respect you guys as critics this film really is out of your jurisdiction, you haven't read the novels and you aren't Harry Potter fans and this film was made to please Harry Potter fans. Anyone who is not impressed by this film simply shouldn't be sitting in the cinema to watch it. I also think that Daniel, Emma, and Rupert have evolved a great deal by this point, excellent performances all around in this film.</p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[8]]<br/>What an incredible film! the action scenes (particularly the forest chase) are brilliantly shot and the CGI is flawless! the shift from action fantasy,  almost to psychological drama gave Rupert, Dan and Emma a real chance to flex their acting muscles and i think they did an excellent job. I dont think the cinematography is as great as it was the last film, but is nonetheless a great film. Having read and loved the books to death i fully support the decision to cut it in two. READ THE BOOKS YOU TWO!<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1))[[9]]<br/>If you've not read the book, you don't REALLY have the right to comment on what takes place in a movie based on a book. Splitting the film in two makes sense as the book is clearly divided 1) searching for horcruxes and exploring relationships between characters 2) non-stop action as the final parts, no battle approaches. Putting this highly complex book into one 2 hour film would mean cutting too much, to the story's detriment. And, I'd rather see a snippet great British actors than nothing at all. I'm glad they played their matter how small.</p>

The movie was split in to two because the fans wanted the last book's movie to NOT "Cut to the chase". Also, why bother seeing a movie about a book if you haven't read it. Let alone a movie about a book that is the Seventh installment of a series.</p>

The previous films had missed so much detail that this one has to be done in 2 episodes. The dark and hopeless feel is deliberate and necessary to represent the books. For David to say the public are being dudded is an example of his ignorance.</p>

I think the only reason David and Margaret review it so low is simply because they haven't read the books. Which is very understandable. It did drag in a few bits, but what the hell I LOVED THIS MOVIE! Poor dobbie :'(</p>

This book is not one that is easy to adapt, as there are no sub-plot, all 600 or so pages are nessararry; hense the two part split.<br/><br/>While the story my be hard to follow for outsiders, the film flows, have wonderful performances and the direction by David Yates with some shaky cam really contrasts the previous films, adding to the sense of erchancy. Not the best Potter film, but not the worst...</p>

Even last years one you gave a very harsh review but it turned out to be pretty good. David you do not know the first thing about them and you are judging this movie based up on the fact you you don't understand it and its dark which it is meant to be. To prefer the first couple of movies you have serious problems as those films were very very average.</p>
