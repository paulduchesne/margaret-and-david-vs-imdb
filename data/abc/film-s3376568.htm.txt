<h2>The Descendants</h2>
<p class="ratd"> Rated <em>M</em></p>
<p><em>Review by Margaret Pomeranz</em></p>
<p>It's taken Alexander Payne seven years to make another film after the success of Sideways so it's not just Australian filmmakers who experience a long time between drinks. THE DESCENDANTS is set in Hawaii where lawyer Matt King -George Clooney - is facing a number of dilemmas. His wife is in a coma as the result of a boating accident and things are not looking good. Also he has to make a decision for the family about a beautiful tract of inherited land, whether to sell it, keep it, put it in a trust. But then comes a shock, his elder daughter Alex, SHAILENE WOODLEY, tells him that her mother had been having an affair. This is a quirky, sad, funny film with fabulous performances, glorious locations and real heart.</p>
<h2>Further comments</h2>
<p>DAVID: I think Alexander Payne is one of the most interesting directors, younger directors, working in America today. I just watched his earlier film ABOUT SCHMIDT again the other day and itís just a wonderful film and it has, in common with SIDEWAYS and THE DESCENDANTS, this film, that all the characters, even the ones you think might initially be a bit unsympathetic, theyíve all got their reasons. They are all beautifully, beautifully portrayed. Like in this film, the boyfriend, the daughterís boyfriend, who at first you sort of side with the George Clooney character in thinking what does she want to drag him along for.<br/><br/>MARGARET: And the father-in-law...<br/><br/>DAVID: Yes, thatís right. And yet he turns out to be such a sweet kid. Itís just a lovely film. Iíve heard him compared with Jean Renoir and I think thereís some truth in that.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Wow!<br/><br/>DAVID: Heís got that generosity in dealing with his characters.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Yes. Yes, there is that sense of compassion, I think, throughout this.<br/><br/>DAVID: Yes. Yes. <br/><br/>MARGARET: And itís not to say that it doesnít have an edge because, that scene where the wifeís in hospital and possibly dying and heís so angry with her... itís sort of quite a confronting scene.<br/><br/>DAVID: Thatís right.<br/><br/>MARGARET: But totally understandable. Every action has a basis in some sort of reality, I think.<br/><br/>DAVID: Absolutely. Itís beautiful in that way and George Clooney, itís another terrific performance. <br/><br/>MARGARET: Yes, heís good, isnít he?<br/><br/>DAVID: Yes.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Heís not just a pretty face.<br/><br/>DAVID: No. I love this film. Iím giving it four and a half.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Iím giving it four.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[9]]<br>I've just re-watched this one and liked it more this time around.  It really falls into the category of what I call the "Sweet song phenomenon" - whereby your degree of liking is highly dependent upon your mood.  Sometimes sweet songs make my heart melt, other times they annoy the crap out of me.  The difference being my mood at the time.  For those who rated this film poorly, I'd urge you to re-watch it down the track when you're in a good but chilled mood.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[8]]<br>A movie to watch by yourself - emotive and involving.  There are probably some elements of this movie that we can all relate  to.  Everyone has baggage. <br><br>Terrific performance all round, particularly by the younger actors.  If there is a fault, maybe the Hawaiian ballads are a tad overdone, and the relatives are not quite as devastated as one might expect.</br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[8]]<br>I watched this film last night.  I liked the faded family pictures on the walls and the stories they told, and how people come from then to now. I thought GC did the man in middle age well.  I liked that the film didn't press those obvious 'cry now' buttons. I wished for more about the  land and the cousins.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[8]]<br>Not quite in the 'Sideways' class but I thought this was a touching movie with the characters nicely developed and the double anguish felt by the Clooney character very well expressed. The Hawaii travelogue was somewhat overdone and the links with Polynesia rather contrived though it did give interesting glimpses of a culture (even if strongly mediated by the USA ) that stretches from there all the way to New Zealand.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[0]]<br>trying to think of anything redeeming... no... really bad cliched movie that I have just walked out on. Hubbie still enduring but only because he picked it. Boring as The American and George doesn't seem to be getting better - both slow and painful movies. Wasted only 1 hour of my life on it, not 2 like some - thank goodness!</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[8]]<br>And that is exactly what makes 'The Descendants' such an excellent movie. The creation, treatment and transitions of each character in the film. The perspective of each character we're given allows us to appreciate and even learn something about the many subtle messages that are placed amongst the crisp and clear writing of the movie. With yet another five star accomplished performance from George Clooney, 'The Descendants' is always insightful and interesting, is touching when it wants to be and offers refreshing humour amidst the many on-screen dramas. A professional and sophisticated, very fine piece of cinema indeed.<br><br/></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[4]]<br>Dont believe the hype! really disappointing  overrated film.  Clooney does watered down Clooney, not so much of the winning smile, just  a permanent bemused look - really strange reactions to the coma their mum/ wife was in. That young guy reminded me of when they bring in new 'lovable' characters into dying sit-coms just for some comic relief- cheesy.   US emoting.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[5]]<br>I'm bemused by all the great press for this film. To my mind, it was flat and uninspiring. The behaviour of the characters  just didn't ring true. A case in point is the scene where GC gets out of bed because he can't sleep, and opens his heart the the rather pointless Sid. Why would he do that? What does he see in Sid that no-one else does? then there's the grandfather, a gross caricature. And who hosts a cocktail party to announce their wife's imminent death? Detached and shallow. Yawn! Not a patch on Sideways.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[9]]<br>Over the years, i have heard the  the term 'life experiences' and its value - must admit did never quite believe it. I'm a male in his mid fifities, which probably explains why I thought this was a very good film (oh should I say movie). good acting, good scritpt, believeavle actors etc etc. My message to the youngsters who just difd not get it. (never thought I ever use that term), I respectifully suggest that you keep a DVD of this film/movie for re-viewing in 30 years time -  you will have a better chance of appreciating it.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[8]]<br>I loved the movie.   George Clooney and the girls were great.   The storyline is great and similar to our situation.   We   have  land  owned by my brothers, sisters, two cousins and I.   Three of us out of 10 owners don't want to sell. We inherited this beautiful pastoral land  from our grandmother. There's an old Maori saying in  New Zealand  "Look after the land and the land will take care of you."  I think Greed comes into it.   So thank you George Clooney and the cast you were all awesome.  The music and setting was great too.   Swearing not good</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[8]]<br>I have never like George Clooney but this film was very special. We went based on Marg and Davids comments and we were very impressed. The depth of the film was the big surprise. The way it dealt with death and the mixture of anger with regret within grief. The scenes felt so natural and uncontrived. The flaws in the characters so real. Thank you- a great experience. I place it with Samson &amp; Delilah.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[3]]<br>This movie felt like unfinished business!!!  Was expecting flashbacks of "George" with his wife in "happier" times to get some sense of his desolation not only at the loss of his wife but also her betrayal.  Also, the accident was not shown so we had no idea of the circumstances of her demise.  Well acted by George and his "daughters".  <br><br>Guess the point was that if tough times do not destroy a family they bring them closer together.  Very tearful but a very shallow film as the characters were not developed to the point that we even cared about them.</br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[8]]<br>Wow, what polarised comments. We really loved this film. Beautiful and natural performances, nice to see George not so suave, the eldest daughter was great. Agree with David, such sympathetic direction of the characters. I suspect Starman below has it right. If you have experienced some of the themes of this film, death and betrayal, it speaks to you. Profound yet understated. See it and make up your own mind!</br></p>

I can't believe the acclaim this film is getting.<br>I always watch Clooney's movies and apart from "the American", which was deadddd  borringgg, I usually enjoy them immensely, but, though better than "The American" there wasn't that much to this movie. If any actor gets an award should be the eldest daughter, and best picture, you've got to be joking!    Is "Midnight in Paris" in the running, that was a 4 1/2 to 5.</br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[4]]<br>I don't know that there's anything  wrong with this movie; it's just there is nobody to like in this movie.  The only 'innocent' was the youngest daughter who they treated abysmally.  They are all selfish, self absorbed people - even the comatose mother.  I have been in a coma myself -  may as well have been during this movie.  <br>Was there any need for the whole 'retarded' conversation; seems the Rword campaign is fighting a losing battle if they still put this rubbish in for a cheap laugh.<br>This is nothing like Sideways and About Schmidt.</br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[8]]<br>Cannot understand the negative comments about this film. I think the rants against the wife in the hospital ring perfectly true and understandable. That is the emotions created by the situation. Clooneys character acknowledged his part in creating his wifes infidelity and his final words to her reveal the love he still feels for her. This was an imperfect family struggling to carry on from a tragedy and make things better in the future. A moving film and not the usual glib George Cooney performance.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[5]]<br>That this film could be nominated for an award for anything, dumbfounds me!  The eldest daughter acted very well but wasn't award worthy.  The tag-along boyfriend and young sister I presume were there to inject humour?  So unamusing!  Was George Clooney's role really a challenge for him?  Did he reneg on the sale because he'd become so enlightened or because he didn't want the lover cashing in?</br></p>

The story tells us he kept money from her and when she sought a new life, she was abused by her new lover in his pursuit of wealth.  I felt horrible at the end of this tedious movie.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[9]]<br>As a guy of similar age to the protagonist, I found this movie emotionally draining but gripping. It deals with end-of-life issues about love and loss in a sensitive and realistic way, I think. I was relieved that they used some of the gorgeous Hawaiian music soundtrack to overlay some of the more heartbreaking scenes, like the 10yo daughter being told about her mother. So strange how polarizing this movie seems to so many. Not sure Clooney deserves an Oscar for his part, but the film most certainly does in some category. A definite go-see.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[9]]<br/>An excellent drama portraying a dysfunctional family in conflict, with a good dose of comedy thrown in to lighten the darker moments.  Love the characters, all beautifully portrayed - George Clooney is fantastic and I really warmed to the teen daughter and her goofy boyfriend.  It made me laugh, made me teary - the full gamut of emotions.  Would happily see this again.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[10]]<br/>I saw this yesterday and thought it was terrific, the cast looked like normal, average, everyday people which makes a change from other movies where everyone is botoxed, fake and have live-in housekeepers. What man wouldn't be curious and angry to find the "other" man? He obviously wanted closure on what was an evident outcome, after being told there was no hope for his wife. The subject matter thought provoking, scenery beautiful, good to see Hawaii not looking like a postcard but how it is sometimes. I can't understand the negative comments below either.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[8]]<br/>This film works satisfyingly on many levels.  The characters are believable, flawed, quirky and wonderfully varied.  The Hawaiian tourist bureau's investment has paid off handsomely in its portrayal of the 50th state.  The twists and contradictions in the plot, with realistic takes on modern family relationships and well set in the historical context of the impact of western explorers and missionaries on the original Hawaiians provides many points to ponder.  I thought George Clooney nailed the conflicts of the role.  The evolution of the father daughter boyfriend relationship was a bit too good to be true but was pleasantly encouraging.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[9]]<br/>I don't wait for a review to determine my choice of movie so had no pre-conceived expectations of this. My life experiences have not been dissimilar to Clooneys character and as such, mostly due to a 'real" script and even more realistic acting, left the cinema with a myriad of emotion. I too believe this is a rare gem (and apologies for the cliche)  but would only recommend it to those who also believe that life is about the journey rather than the destination.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[6]]<br/>Just an average movie.  Cannot compare this with Sideways or About Schmidt which are far superior.  Yes, it is an interesting exploration of the relationship father-daughters and how it evolves in the wake of tragedy.  And good cinematography.  But that's it.  As per George Clooney this is far from being his best performance.  Pretty average and tired, actually.  A very far cry from his really outstanding performances (Good Night and Good Luck, Syriana, Michael Clayton, Up in the Air).  Overall a disappointment.  Pitty.</p>

The group I was with was divided on their opinion to whether the film was lacklustre in content and boring or in fact a brilliant look at life and its personal complications. I really loved it. I loved its pace, cinematography, soundtrack and most importantly acting. George Clooney has undoubtedly made his best film in years. Here's hoping his winning streak continues!</p>

Great script, tremendous acting and very believable situations. How refreshing to view a movie that can give your emotions a full on workout without relying on special effects or being corny or cheesy. This movie dragged me in a took me on a joyous ride - relax and let it take you.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[3]]<br/>what a disappointment ! i thought the lack of interest in the script and the unrealistic plot was very disappointing.  it was so out of touch with reality - who travels away from their dying loved one and in the last few days? only ego does that !  yes he had stuff to resolve, but really? a lack of any decent dialogue (bring back elizabeth taylor) and the more beautiful scenes of the hawaiian islands were absent in the cinematography. dvd.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[9]]<br/>Wow where do I start. I was engrossed in this film from the very start. It had a feel about it that draws you in. The 3 main characters Matt and his two daughters were excellent. Daughter Alexandra showed maturity in caring for and protecting her father  as he was grieving.Her initial hard exterior was beautifilly peeled away. It was a strong performance by Shailene Woodley. George Clooney is always good. I have just read the other reviews below. I am still happy with my review.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[7]]<br/>At The Movies might as well turn this review facility off because relatively few people actually get anywhere near the global truth of a film and are merely spouting their myopic selfish view based probably more on what they'd eaten for dinner than what the film was actually worth.  All films are worth something to someone, otherwise nobody would bother making them. If you come with your ego-filled and critical mind, you will miss 90% of it and hence end up giving it zero or one star. This film was slightly below par compared to Sideways, yes, but still worthy.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[8]]<br/>Very confronting.  Similar personal situations made this movie very hard to watch.  But, what stays with me, is the fact that I was so uncomfortable that I couldn't look away.  Tears and laughter in almost equal measure.  The fact that it made me empathize with the sometimes pathetic characters, I love it all the more.  The writer obviously wanted to push the boundaries of the (ignorant stereotypical) audience - isn't that the point?  That in itself is what impressed me the most.<br/>Go see MI4 if you want mindless entertainment.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[8]]<br/>A terrific examination of our existence and of what we leave behind. From our treatment and relationships with our family through to our treatment and relationship with our planet. Our actions mould the future. Executed in a non confrontational way it is a movie you must actively engage rather than sit back and wait to be entertained.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[4]]<br/>You know why everyone says George Clooney is good in this? Because there's nothing else to notice. Good on him for taking on the challenge, but watching this movie is like watching Roger Federer play a game of ping pong: so much talent with nothing to do. The script is undercooked, poorly dramatised and too loosely interwoven. The cinematography is at the standard of serialised TV and the director appears to have forgotten that film is supposed to be life with the boring bits removed.  Recommended only for filmmakers as a series of lessons in what not to do.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[2]]<br/>Interesting how all the critics rave about this one but the majority of movie goers  don't rate it at all. We saw it on Saturday night and it was pretty average, slow and full of cliches. It's as if the likes of D&amp;M feel they have to say good things about it because all the other critics and the Academy loved it. Would be refreshing to hear a renowned critic come out and take a contrarian view.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[5]]<br/> The Descendents was far from being 'the best movie of the year'. As the mosaic of the film was revealed I started to feel a sense of dissatisfaction as I found the setting for the story to be implausible. To witness a comatose patient is far from a pleasant experience. The unfolding events of the film created a sense that one can quite easily get on with life in spite of the fact that a loved one is at death's door.  The petty goings on about the land deal was  a boring distraction. Clooney-"great acting"- you have to be joking</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[3]]<br/>Very disappointed after reading the reviews.  This did not strike any compassion with me and is a movie I will not remember.  The saving graces in the movie are the characters of the elder daughter and Syd her boyfriend.  The scene to remember - Syd explaing to George C how his father had died recently.  The rest of the movie is a waste of time.<br/><br/>I really think now that movie critics are so far up themselves they believe in the own perceived intellectualism.  Guys - the movie is crap.</p>

A man who is absent in his roles as father and husband, and caretaker, is forced to confront all these issues. As well, social responsibility and family values are scrutinised. Brilliant performances from everyone, particularly Clooney who plays a dull lawyer who comes to life under stress.</p>

I think the answer is sort of a negative--there was no drama, no interesting characters, no anything to sink the teeth into.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[9]]<br/>I thought this movie was just as described by D &amp; M  - Clooney's  performance is terrific. I encourage people not to be put off by the negative comments below, sure it's not a comedy although not without humour. The real engine of the movie is the shifting position of the characters almost all of them. I thought this way better than 'Sideways' and I'll certainly watch 'About Schmidt' on the strength of this one. If people really want to grumble about a waste of  their time go see It Never Did Me Any Harm at the STC.</p>

Dad despite developing a late conscience and remorse for a lost civilization would  tire very quickly of  watching TV with the kids  .The  tearful  undeserved final kiss  bordered on the absurd . Not in the same league as Sideways It was still an interesting film and  if nothing else an instructive lesson in 'paradise lost' observing the  destructive force of consumerism on native populations. <br/><br/><br/></p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[2]]<br/>I'm angry that I wasted two precious hours of my life on this film. I stayed in the theatre only because I thought it had to improve .. it didn't. Repulsive characters, ridiculous storyline, shallow, unbelievable, at times even laughable. Sadly, I can't rely anymore on D and M to save me from such twaddle. One star for the scenery - but then who couldn't take could pics of Hawaii?</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[4]]<br/>this isn't up to the standard of the director's previous film SIDEWAYS. It's an average midday tv movie with nice cinematography of the Hawaiian islands. That's about it. I've never been into films that deal with grief and mourning of lost ones. Not my cup of tea.</p>

The script is interesting and intelligent, the Hawaian setting is beautiful and the actors are fantastic - especially George Clooney and the girl who plays his eldest daughter. They both deserve Academy Awards. Clooney brings such depth to every role he plays. Loved him in 'Ides of March'; loved him in this.</p>

George Clooney better suited to his character in The Ides of March. I thought Shailene Woodley's performance was much better.

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[5]]<br/>I cannot agree with D&amp;M.  This was very average indeed. Persuaded by the number of 4 star reviews, I was so disappointed.  It's just an average movie, albeit with good performances.  I can't believe Clooney gets a Golden Globe for crying and being angry (two emotions I don't recall in his past work).  It's a great visitor promotion for Hawaii however.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[9]]<br/>Bother. I really appreciated how the film enabled you to see the lady-in-coma through different characters perspectives. Do you have an opinion of her role as a mum/ wife/ daughter even though you only saw her conscious on screen for less than a minute? George Clooney's character expressed the sum of his feelings when he said goodbye. Joy/pain the whole lot.<br/>I just found it difficult to believe that he started out with such a big disconnection with his daughters. Loved the final scene.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[9]]<br/>Moving, interesting and real characters. Story unfolded in a lovely way. The local music and scenery was fabulous. I was very happy that the young man friend of the teenage daughter stayed as sweet and gawky as he did and didn't become a kind of guru who the main character 'learned a lesson' from. Wonderful entertainment. I am astonished that other viewers have been so critical. What wasn't to like about this film? Not over the top in sentimentality or moralising like so many Hollywood films and a great interesting story on coming to terms with sudden death and changes.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[5]]<br/>Quite enjoyable but not an outstanding film. Whenever I read 'one of George Clooney's best performances' in the future I'll be wary. I am still not convinced he is a good actor, unless overacting is a talent. Good to look at and that's about it. The kids were annoying, and the boyfriend, what a pathetic and unbelievable character, he wasn't needed. I guess Hollywood has sucked us all in, the cinema was full so the takings will be rocketing.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[7]]<br/>Pleasant enough but unworthy of the Oscar hype.  Clooney's opening "living in paradise" narration sounded so contrived - trying to convince us this film really has "something to say".  Typically Hollywood take on marital problems &amp; family tragedy.  The message I got was:  Unless you're significantly wealthy, have a house with a swimming pool, own a huge tract of land and are able to treat your issues by staying in 5-star hotels and jetting about at will....then Hollywood just isn't interested in your problems!  The realistically dull portrayal of Hawaii was the most real part of this film.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[10]]<br/>It's hard to believe we are all talking about the same movie. I think people over-react to when a big star is involved. But that aside, fear not, this is an absolutely brilliant film. Driven almost entirely by well-scripted dialogue and perfect casting - no-one puts a foot wrong. Clooney will win an Oscar for his performance.  Like Sideways, the plot is drenched in the environment - most films the story can take place anywhere, but Hawaii is another character. It's refreshing to see a move where there are no sinister overtones, what you see is what you get.  Outstanding.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[9]]<br/>I can completely understand why some people rated this film so poorly, but if it 'gets to you' the way it did to me (and I saw it 2 days ago and it is still with me) then you will love it. I agree that the older daughter is brilliant, I loved George Clooney's portrayal. For anyone who is curious - particularly because of the divergent views - have a look. Beautiful scenery, so big screen is probably best. I agree with those who said it is not perfect, but for me what it does get right is completely perfect.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[3]]<br/>I was hesitant to see this after seeing a preview and I was right to be. What a disappointment! Voiceovers are a terrible sign of a poorly scripted movie in need of help. Then again, there was nothing to script - the plot is weak. I'm a Clooney fan but how he's winning awards for this is beyond me. An unbelievable premise that is hard to relate to (stingy land baron, really?), full of cliches and overly sentimental. Avoid, avoid!</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[7]]<br/>Fantastic acting, especially the three young characters.  Loved the scenery and there were some powerful moments.  Didn't like the 'men have it so hard because women are so awful' undertone, and had little sympathy for Clooney's character.   If you want to see a superb, nuanced, and moving film about grief, see 'Genoa' starring Colin Firth and Catherine Keener.  Far superior!</p>

Payne might have been trying to make a statement about the modern man hapless and struggling, or on a grieving panicked family and the seething undercurrents but it didn't work for me.... what was the Sid thing about? were we supposed to take handsome lawyer Matt's entreaty for help to a character depicted as a complete idiot ...seriously? and could they have popped ms Woodley's nubile young body into one more new bikini?  .

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[6]]<br/>Just saw this last night and still not sure how I feel about it. <br/>The young girls and Syd were outstanding, but George verged constantly from controlled and outstanding to melodramatic over-acting. It was as if he had moments of thinking he was back in the obscure comedy environs of the latest Coen brothers movie.  The plot felt so incongrous and overstretched that I thought it must be based on a true story, with tragi-comedy tension that never really resolved.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[9]]<br/>A beautiful film in many ways. The direction is superb. The acting too. You can believe in what's portrayed. It is not predictable as so many movies are. There's a genuine warmth to this just as there is an edge. A story about  a disengaged father who redeems himself not by any spectacular acts but simply by doing the small thing better and making the right choices. Clooney excels as do all the cast.

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[6]]<br/>I agree with Lynne. Good but definetly NOT great. My wife and I left the theatre thinking why all reviewers loved this film, especially Margaret and David. Nothing totally rang true and we actually thought the Hawaii post card scenes made it look wet, overcast and drab. I normally like George but I had no sympathy for this guy. I get yelling at your cheating wife but not why you need to meet your dying wifes lover. The kids were OK but the extended family cousins just didn't add up. The environmental message also seemed to get lost in translation.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[3]]<br/>This is a very overrated movie. The direction can't decide between comedy or drama and does neither at all well. As a result the audience in my screening laughed at inappropriate times throughout. The most convincing acting was done by Elizabeth Hastie, who plays the comatose wife throughout. Clooney just plays Clooney - the drover's dog could have done just as well.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[6]]<br/>This is a good film but certainly not worth more than 3 stars. The characters are not engaging and need more development. I really didn't care what happened to them; I certainly couldn't fathom the function of the boyfriend - he didn't move the plot along, develop conflicts or contribute in any meaningful way to the film. What was the point of this film - to watch someone dying because that's the main event. The characters didn't really change from the beginning to the end and I think there was opportunity for them to grow/develop. Still good but not fantastic!</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[1]]<br/>This is an absolutely terrible movie. There is nothing here to draw the viewer in. I saw it with my mum on her 64th birthday and we both left the cinema wondering why anyone would bother making a movie with so little depth. Even the likes of transformers and the marvel movies at least had something happening (no, I'm not saying that they were cinematographic masterpieces). Each of the characters is nothing like the voice over describes them to be; Clooney's character who according to the VO is a backup parent and focuses more on his job than his family</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[7]]<br/>I did not think this was a brilliant film, even though I loved Sideways in 2004. There were too many unrealistic events packed into this film, and it just didn't ring true.  Also, I would definitely have liked to hear more about the issues faced by the family in terms of their Indigenous background and identity, as well as their current relationships with the Indigenous communities in Hawaii.  This could not have been treated more superficially.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[10]]<br/>What do we pass on to our descendants? Simply by living we make choices that will affect them. This is a movie about choices. George Cooney is sorrowful, angry, perplexed, sympathetic and comical but always believable as the grieving husband discovering more about his comatosed wife than he would like. The film avoids the pitfalls of schmaltzy melodrama by confronting all the issues head on wiithout flinching. Some movies leave me hurriedly wiping away tears before the lights go on but this powerful and frank movie left me philosphically pondering what I would have done in George Cooney's place.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[8]]<br/>Loved it! A really absorbing film. Thought provoking with more than one layer-I had to reassess my initial feelings about all the characters as the movie went on. (The only squirm-making thing was the fact that The Dad and Mum Suburboids in front had brought their primary school aged son - boy did that kid get an education; someone's going to have to  sort out his head and mouth in days to come. Get a babysitter!)</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[8]]<br/>A good film is one that moves you on a number of levels. This one has it all: pathos, humor, confrontation and a superb cast led by George Clooney - his best work since Good Night and Good Luck. He is a consummately good actor with a broad skill-set of emotional interpretation, and for someone who's never had children delivers an utterly convincing performance as a parent with out-of-control children.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[7]]<br/>Felt slightly disappointed with this.  Although there were some great performances by Clooney and the younger cast members , I thought it took too long in the end to get where it was obviously going.<br/>After the positive reviews it's received so far, I guess I was expecting too much.<br/>The scenes of some of the lesser known regions of Hawaii were enjoyable.</p>

Half a star for the beautiful scenery...I can understand the director's intention behind each scene but the acting especially Clooney was just incongruent.  Hiding behind hedges, weird eye movements in the restaurant bar and slowing falling to his knees on the grass outside his house, one knee now the other and now throw myself forward OMG give me a break !

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[6]]<br/>The story of this film is quite endearing and it's nice to see an innovative storyline for a change. But the acting, casting and directing were all pretty average. There was virtually no character development, and some of the plot was too far fetched to fit with the rest of the film; like the father asking the daughter's tag along boyfriend for advice on how to raise his two girls. I cried, it was sad, but still I can see why it's been so long between films for this director - wait for DVD or read the book.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[3]]<br/>The one star is for George who did a good job of looking angry and cute at the same time.  The half is for the poor wife Elizabeth for keeping her face straight when being subjected to the indignant anger and abuse by George &amp; Alex who seemed more upset at the affair than the fact she was in fact dying. It's hard to believe the cousins were having a cheerful enough meeting about the land sale as the life line was being turned off. The swearing was also unnecessary in most parts and really didn't add impact or value.</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[0]]<br/>I am absolutely appalled by your review of The descendants. How can you both say this film had compassion? Is it compassionate to yell and scream obscenities into the face of an unconcious and dying woman, no matter what the reason. The whole film was about selfish issues re the family and satisfying their own issues, no thought or real love for a mother and wife.  I  dont think either of you have ever sat beside a loved one while they are on life support, or had to make the soul destroying decision to turn off life support.</p>

Never felt like it was a real family.  Didn't feel like they fitted together at all.  Even at the end.  And what was it with the boyfriend????  What did he bring to the film at all.  Clooney wasn't bad I suppose but he rarely is.<br/>One star from me!</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[9]]<br/>Andrew Gillard is obviously a philistine of sorts. How could anyone not be touched by this very well thought out and realistic portrayal of family angst. The performances were excellent, the scenery and settings were anything but contrived and the dialogue full of subtle nuances and momentary turns of pace, leaving you exasperated and heartbroken. I love ho w Alexander Payne interweaves the story into its quasi American/Hawaiian context without delving into paradisaical  cliches and easy answers. Oscar for George Clooney!</p>

<p class="comment">((The Descendants))[[9]]<br/>Understated and real. Grief and Loss themes are presented in an honest way - moving but so grounded in what the process is like for a family enduring the last days of a loved one's life. The subtlety with which the movie deals with themes such as family norms, values and history is outstanding - the scene with the father in law visiting the hospital is especially poignant in illustrating this point. As is the scene with Matt and Syd when it is discovered Syd has more wisdom about life - and loss than Matt had given him credit for.</p>
