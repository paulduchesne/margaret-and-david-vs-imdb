<h2>Gravity</h2>
<p class="ratd"> Rated <em>M</em></p>
<p><em>Review by David Stratton</em></p>
<p>Far out in space, three American astronauts have left their shuttle to work on a Hubble telescope; we barely get to meet one of them but the other two are veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski, GEORGE CLOONEY, and first-timer Dr. Ryan Stone, SANDRA BULLOCK. The atmosphere is relaxed, Kowalski cracks jokes to help his colleague overcome her nervousness. And then disaster strikes: a Russian satellite self-destructs and a mass of debris heads directly towards the three Americans.<br/><br/>The first film Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron has made since the very impressive CHILDREN OF MEN seven years ago is the best space movie since 2001. The long, 13-minute, opening shot in which the camera seems to float through space following the astronauts on what for them should be a routine mission is mesmerising - the more so if you see it in 3D, and I urge you to do that. Cuaron's screenplay, written with his son, Jonas, isn't strongly plot-driven; there are none of the trappings of conventional science fiction, no monsters, no bad guys at all. Just human beings in the vastness and eeriness of space, trying to survive after an unexpected disaster. The camerawork by Emmanuel Lubezki is amazing, the production design by Andy Nicholson is equally outstanding. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, GRAVITY isn't quite a masterpiece; there's some rather clunky dialogue and, more importantly, there's a scene in the second half that should never have been included and which brought unintended laughs from the audience when I saw it. Despite these flaws, GRAVITY is an amazing experience.</p>
<h2>Further comments</h2>
<p>DAVID: Margaret?<br/><br/>MARGARET: It is an amazing experience. It is 90 minutes of sweaty palms.<br/><br/>DAVID: It sure is.<br/><br/>MARGARET: I was on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>DAVID: Absolutely. So was I.<br/><br/>MARGARET: It looks so fantastic. To maintain that tension of that period of time with a limited number of players, it's situational drama absolutely.<br/><br/>DAVID: Yes.<br/><br/>MARGARET: It's just really clever.<br/><br/>DAVID: It looks so real too. You really feel this is what it's like to be in space.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Well, and it taps into our deep fears of being out there alone and cut off from earth and help me! Help me! But I think he's done a wonderful, wonderful job. I think he's a really intelligent filmmaker. I think those two, it must have been very uncomfortable for them to film in those suits but I just think it's one of those films that you can be just honestly enthusiastic about. I didn't even mind that scene. <br/><br/>DAVID: Well, I did because it broke the spell. It was sort of corny and it wasn't of a peace with the rest of the film and that was a shame, I thought. <br/><br/>MARGARET: Well, there was maybe a slight demure in me about it, you know, but I thought the whole was so terrific that I went, ah, I'm going to allow you that little flip.<br/><br/>DAVID: The whole is pretty good. I'm unforgiving.<br/><br/>MARGARET: I'm giving this four and a half stars, David.<br/><br/>DAVID: I'm giving it four. <br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[5]]<br>Slo burn sci fi for bogans, so overrated, cloons and bollocks are so bad to watch in this film it was embarrassing. Opening scene visually spectacular then it's all downhill rapidly after that. Only thing more disappointing is M &amp; D review.. are you guys serious..?</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[3]]<br>The only thing, and I repeat the only thing, that was of any interest or worth watching was the excellent special effects of the shuttle being torn to pieces. They seem to have done a great job on the physics engine (at least visually). The rest was just Hollywood rubbish not worth the effort of making or watching</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[9]]<br>An amazing film. See it at all costs. Disturbing imagery is the only thing likely to offend anyone unless you count Sandra Bullock being barely audible. I got kinda restless, but mostly, it's a non-stop thrill ride. 3D is it. Blu-ray, at least.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[7]]<br>Gravity, that dull old earthbornness that gives us life. Without it, no air to breathe, no atmosphere to protect us, no way to talk and no easy way to move. That's exactly the dilemma facing two astronauts who are catapulted out of their coocon of safety when unexpected space junk trashes their ship. The story is realistic, believable and at moments pleasantly humdrum. George Clooney is a warm but knowledgeable support to a scared and stressed Sandra Bullock. As viewers and space neophytes we share all Sandra's  fears. An interesting, beautiful and thought provoking movie with a message.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[9]]<br>Anyone complaining about plot or character development didn't see the movie on the big screen in 3D. <br><br>I would normally say 3D is hype but this movie is a complete exception.  Even David urges you to see it in 3D at the cinema! David!<br><br>It's all about suspending disbelief and pulling the audience into the scene and *nothing* has ever come close to this film when you see it at the cinema in 3D. <br><br>To be blunt: if you missed it at the cinemas you've missed it. Don't bother watching this at home. It just doesn't work.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[1]]<br>After having just wasted some 90 minutes of my life watching this nonsense, I felt compelled to rate this film. I can't even begin to describe how boring I found the whole unpleasant experience. The only reason I watched the damned film was because it was on so many reviewer's Top Ten Films of 2013 lists. The only explanation I can give for David and Margaret giving it such high ratings is that they were bribed by the company that distributed this movie in Australia.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[2]]<br>I was looking forward to this movie. Missed it at the cinema so bought it on blueray. Unequivocally one of the stupidest films I have ever seen. Visually strong, but more holes than a fishing net. People scoring this film highly are just getting caught in the hype it seems. Acting was poor, script non existent, soundtrack overpowering and intrusive, characters one dimensional, far too many coincidences. The ending was trite and ridiculous. A total waste of time. Rather than watch this movie, go down to the corner and watch the traffic lights change. It will be far more interesting.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[4]]<br>Quite Possibly the most over hyped movie of 2013. The plot is awful and lacks any substance! Putting Bullock and Clooney in it certainly doesn't improve this. I gave it two stars because despite the poor story the film is truly beautiful. Just like Avatar this film is best viewed when the sound is turned off while you are trying to purchase a new TV from JB HI-FI.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[9]]<br>This movie is way better than 2001: a space odyssey. People who don't think so need to re watch Kubrick's movie. <br>Unlike Gravity; <br>- 2001 is painfully long (remember there are three parts), <br>- has the most sterile and under-deveopled charters (HAL is the only one with an ounce of personality, Clooney and Sandra at least have emotions and a back story) <br>- and 2001's story is unintelligible, except for the good bit in the middle everyone remembers.<br><br>Gravity is a landmark piece of sci-fi cinema like 2001; except with better characters, clearer storey and a shorter running time. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[8]]<br>It looks more like a film about rebirth. Here is a woman who has lost her child. She faces death and is tempted to give up and in that 'clunky' scene decides to live. There is an image of her in a foetal position floating in an airlock - complete with umbilical cord. (and, although I may be stretching this a bit, a lot of crawling through narrow tubes and after landing on earth emerging from water onto the land). I think it is a mistake to focus on the space stuff. That is the background to the main story</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[10]]<br>Is this movie believable? Not really. Is it even supposed to be believable? Probably not.<br><br> But honestly, who cares? If you're after astrophysical accuracies or real-life space disaster stories then watch a 'real-life' documentary.<br><br>The simple story line makes this film work because it allows the viewer to focus on the main character's perilous few hours in space - the unknown, death, isolation, loss, abandonment, hope etc.<br><br>Definitely worth a watch, unless of course, you're after a 'real life' space drama or you just generally oppose Hollywood movies (in which case you'll just be biased from the outset).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[3]]<br>I wonder at the loss of a good story to special effects. There are a couple of scenes where the obvious intent was to make the viewer queasy when viewing in 3D, which I regard as poor production.<br><br>I am truly amazed at the scores that Margaret and David gave this. It was a poor story line with little content. Take way the 3D and the space theme at there was little left.

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[9]]<br>This film really left me WOWED. Sandra Bullock plays the part fantastically, and George Clooney is great, as always. this movie reignited my fear of being alone in Space, and just how unforgiving it can be. Also, the effects are beautiful. A very Oscar-worthy movie, would definitely reccomend it to people.</br></p>

But acting terrible and the script so cheesy.<br><br>Can't believe M &amp; D's scores!<br><br>Film totally ignored laws of physics and typical of some directors disrespect for reality and truth  i.e. "space travel", "historic events" etc.".

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[10]]<br>Neil Degrasse Tyson, astrophysicist and director of the Hayden Planetarium, stated that while there were some inaccuracies in the script, the physics, unlike some commentators have stated, held-up to scrutiny. <br><br>Gravity was a successful marriage of special effects and research which created a plausible story which, despite the absence of zap-guns, giant robots or mighty heroes fighting evil bad-guys, still resulted in a white-knuckle ride for this reviewer. Gravity was about the terror inherent in space-flight, and the risks men and women take every time they leave the Earth's atmosphere. <br><br>Gravity has raised the bar for scientifically accurate science fiction.</br></br></br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[7]]<br>Clooney has too much comedy behind him to be really taken seriously. Sandra Bullocks acting was much preferrred and was somewhat more believable.Technically way beyond brilliant ( so therefore hard to score because as far as substance goes.....nnnyyyeehhh...... so so. Pure fantasy for sure as most unlikely that this 'event' would be survivable.Ending bummed me out...faint sound of approaching helicopter would have been better. Left with feeling of "All that money spent...I much prefer movies with substance made with very little."</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[9]]<br>We've just watched Gravity on our home theatre system and I have to say it was one of the best movies I've seen in quite a while.  I was sceptical that even with my two very favourite actors, it would be difficult to maintain the level of entertainment predicted by the Awards it received.  However, it was totally entertaining throughout and the sound was amazing. The visual effects weren't too shabby either!  A fantastic film of feeling and suspense.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[10]]<br>WOW! What an incredible film. You cannot criticise the dialogue when the visual effects, cinematography and editing are perfection. Sometimes you need acknowledge that films are designed to be enjoyed for their suspense, rather than being "realistic". Why do films always have been be realistic? Films are not real life depictions. Any film that makes me short of breath and keeps me on the edge of my seat is worthy to me. Five stars without a doubt.</br></p>

That my wife actually fell asleep in the theater is a damning indictment! I realize that we may be in the small minority of watchers that didn't like it but we found the whole thing a yawn. But great visuals, to be sure.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[8]]<br/>i dont know what to say...laws of physics aren't right...Sandra Bullock is one dimensional...you ppl are crazy...i sat down and watched this film and was mesmerised...it didnt have to be character driven...they didnt need hugely overwhelming back stories...i simply thought...wow...space is amazing...and scary....and how normal actions for us have massive  ramifications up there...besides all that it was a welcomed refreshing distraction from all those same same movies....watch it and enjoy it for what it is....</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[0]]<br/>Paid $20 for the DVD--watched it last night 7 Mar 14---Great Special FX--poor dialogue--poor technical scripting--so many scientific holes which in this enlightened age cannot be ignored.<br/>The Re-entry for instance--this is not done by pure luck--a degree out either way results in burn up on entering our atmosphere or bouncing off same and zooming back out into space.<br/>Very disappointed with this effort at a "suspense" filled experience--may scare the little kiddies but not for this SciFi buff.<br/>.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[10]]<br/>I dont know about everyone else, but I go to the movies for pure escapism. It's been a long time since I have enjoyed a movie in every way including the length of time. Please note to other film directors, a good movie can be made under the 2hour mark. At least the reviewers who gave no stars could have given 1 for the movie length. My final say is "Lighten up People"</p>

I did not connect with anyone.  <br/><br/>This movie was an insult to anyone half inteligent enough to realize how wrong everything was, from "point and click" orbital transfers to the stations to using a fire extinguisher as an EVA propellent.  Just awful, wouuld have laughed my way out of the theater if i didnt rent it.  One star for the shiny effects.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[6]]<br/>Too many times in this movie the laws of physics were overruled or simply ignored. Naturally, that was done in order to create spectacular visual effects and from its technical point of view the movie should deserve at least 4 stars. But I didn't get sweaty hands and didn't sit on the edge of my seat because basically every time I was getting close to it another "that's not the way the laws of physics work" moment made me laugh and distracted me from the movie.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[10]]<br/>This film was my favourite of 2013, and reminded me of how intelligent a director Alfonso Cuaron really is. Steven Price's blend of technological samples, choir and string orchestra made an unbelievable score, cinematography left me mesmerised and the 3D visual effects, my god, I actually thought they went into space to film this picture. They were that realistic. The decision to muffle the outside noises of the vacuum was a smart move and not being able to hear the explosions added to the suspense because we get scared when we hear things first, not see them first. Beautiful film</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[1]]<br/>I cannot believe that M&amp;D rated this above 1 star. There was no plot! The female lead, was given a sad story on which to base her existence, patronising! Why not because she was smart, ambitious and extraordinarily talented! The Clooney one liners predictable and pathetic, surely it has to be more than clever! I have now lost complete faith in M&amp;D's assessment. In fact I am shocked and mortified! I couldn't have cared less whether either survived, in fact hoped for their speedy demise just to shorten the whole tiresome affair.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[6]]<br/>I saw Gravity last night, expecting a film that would engage me with characters played by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney.  While I was swayed by the visual effects I was unable to care for the astronauts because the narrative did not create a thread to my heart.  Bullock was truly awesome but I couldn't identify with the loss of her character's child.  Rather corny that Clooney came back as a spirit to urge her not to give up. I didn't leave the theater saying that the film was AWESOME because it was definitely not AWESOME for me. 97%?  NO!</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[2]]<br/>The one star is for the 3D special effects, which were pretty good. But, that's about it folks. Plot: banal and flimsy. Character development: zero. Believability: you've got to be kidding. The science: laughable. Advice: stay at home and have another look at Apollo 13 or Kubrick. The greatest puzzle, however, is why do M and D continually reward provably rubbishy films with so much cinematic worth.</p>

A physical and emotional experience, exhilarating, enthralling.  I didn't eat, drink, cough ..... I did nothing but gaze and thrill and occasionally go to dodge a piece of flying space debris. What a trip, and what a lovely reminder that self belief and a will to survive can make a huge difference to outcomes. Not always, but definitely in some situations.<br/><br/>Agree that the Lullabying Greenland Inuit scene was a tad dodge though ....</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[9]]<br/>It is an amazing experience. Story wise many people will find it boring, even many people think it's just space opera. I went to watch it  with an open mind and I really liked the way is done and found some of the scenes quite powerful. For many when she revolves in the fetal position, umbilical cord attached its corny but for me was like she was reborn. Fighting against odds is something very human and is shown through the eyes of the character. At the end what it matters is life over anything else.</p>

I wanted to walk out but somehow hoped it would improve...David and Margaret's 4 and 4 1/2 stars echoed in my brain as I thought maybe there would be a brilliant plot would something happen...it just got worse and worse Clooney's cameo appearance....trite at best....made me want to puke and oh so very American...at it's very worst. <br/>Oh dear once again particularly David's opinion has gone way down in my estimation</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[7]]<br/>a lot of interesting reviews. Surprised by the high marks of David and Margaret. I think another 15 minutes of preamble at the Cape Canaveral HQ would have rounded out  the story. The movie was only 90 minutes so another 15 would not have  over done it.

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[8]]<br/>Wow.  Not about the movie necessarily (though I did enjoy it), but the silly comments being made here.  I always smile when someone claims they walked out of a good movie halfway through - you wasted your money, cool.  And those giving it no stars even though they thought it looked fantastic... wait, what?  Oh well.  I also don't get the criticism of the ending - after everything Bullock's character went through up there, people don't understand why she reacts the way she does at the end?  Not a perfect movie, but still pretty damn impressive.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[0]]<br/>This was the WORST movie of the year. One line summary: Sandra Bullock heavily panting for 90 minutes. Any high school graduate could write a better script than the writers did here. Shame on the makers of this film. However, the visuals were amazing... As a big time space enthusiast, I am shocked at the awful inaccuracies in this film - which is all the worse because it is evident that the film was shot in actual space training facilities on earth (NASA, etc). This is not science fiction. Appalled!</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[4]]<br/>The first half was absolutely brilliant and fast approaching '2001' status and then... the entire film just fell apart. I'm not sure what happened, whether the scriptwriters were given a hurry up by the producer, but how many cliches, near misses and stereotypes can a film contain? It could have been a lot more subtle and better crafted. A masterpiece contains two brilliant halves - Gravity: first half was worth 7 Stars, the second half, 1 Star. This one is not a masterpiece at all. Really surprised by all the hype.</p>

Perhaps that's not an issue if you've never eveb watched anything on Discovery channel with a rocket in it.<br/><br/>But what a terrible schmaltzy script with such infantile themes. So the effects looked good - that's like saying you went to see a film and despite it being crap, "it was in focus all the way through".<br/><br/>Do people really expect so little of a film?<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[7]]<br/>The film was visually wonderful, but was full of faults. The altitude distances between the two LEO (low earth orbit) stations wouldn't allow for even such a remarkably fortunate rendezvous for a free floating astronaut. The computer animated model of the Chinese Space Stn was in fact the Russian Mir - deorbited in March 2001. Nonetheless that simulacrum of the "bear" like land form in the films opening sequence is indeed real which I found on Google Earth - Bahia de Banderas in Mexico. Perhaps a tribute to the directors home?</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[4]]<br/>From someone who used to enjoy  watching NASA TV coverage of shuttle missions, this was sadly disappointing and corny. Maybe I expect too much authenticity in a space film, but to survive being thrown and bashed about that much is ridiculous. The thought that the HST, ISS and Tiangong are in anywhere near the same orbit is unlikely, and somehow I don't think female astronauts would wear mascara in space. Not much of a story either.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[8]]<br/>A spectacular film visually - one of the best - but sadly let down by Hollywood cliches, and it really fails to capitalise on profound themes. This was due to the limitations of the actors and a dismal script. I don't think the scene M &amp; D are talking about should have been excluded - it was clearly important - however it failed due to the aforementioned poor script and Bullock really isn't quite up to doing it justice. Despite all these shortcomings, definitely worth seeing (especially in 3D!) even if just for the visuals.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[7]]<br/>Thoroughly enjoyed watching this. The superb effects had me dodging space junk in my seat. Great tension, with some wonderfully poignant sequences and truly epic cinematic moments (oh that tear floating through space!!!). All this capped off by a rollicking plummet through the stratosphere to bring us back down to Earth made for a really fun way to pass the afternoon. Definitely see it on the big screen in 3D for full effect.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[8]]<br/>I thought this film was a jolly good ride and fine in every department except parts of the script as David and others have said and that incongruous scene. It didn't make me laugh but it was a clumsy, age-old narrative device as was the proliferation of near-death encounters rapid fire, entertaining but the quantity pushed it a bit. I happily suspended disbelief on all points other commenters complained about, surely these narrative devices are contrived for excitement and filmmakers showcasing skills? Boring, what the...? Imo the brighter sparks amongst my fellow commenters nailed its deeper, profound themes.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[10]]<br/>As a person studying screenplay writing. This movie does have a pretty crystal clear story. Every visual and sound IS the story. People who say it doesn't have a story are just plain stupid and don't know what they're talking about. They don't even know the difference between the terms "plot"(physical obstacle) and "story"(emotional obstacle). Always misusing these terms and acting like experts<br/>. Gravity is about a widow overcoming the loss of her child and the setting of cold empty space is a metaphor of her feelings and inner journey. This is a wonderful story about not giving up.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[1]]<br/>I was so disappointed in this movie. My friend and I walked out after 45 minutes! David and Margaret gave it excellent ratings; WHY?<br/><br/>It had the potential to be a gripping drama about the ability of extraordinary individuals, in what is an extremely remote and hostile environment, to accomplish the seemingly impossible! Apollo 13 did it. Gravity on the other hand, was not based on fact like Apollo 13 but it wasn't even close to drama or a thriller!<br/><br/>It was technically flawed in every respect and dripping with cliches! It may work as a comedy?!<br/><br/>Don't bother!</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[6]]<br/>All this was missing was a car chase !<br/><br/>Its hard to believe some of the hype surrounding this film. A lot of critics, Pomerantz included have clearly lost the plot.<br/><br/>Massively disappointing as far as plot, dialogue and credibility go (sorry, that's the film not Margaret. But then again.)<br/><br/>Not to sound like some kind of film-snob (coz I'm not) I would actually go and see it again, such was the great work with the 3D and overall polish of the graphics. But ..... as for anything else positive it was very disappointing, other than George Clooney's cheesy Buzz Lightyear impersonation.<br/><br/><br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[2]]<br/>If 'script is everything' then I really should give this zero stars but will give one star for the incredible VFX and Sound Design. I found myself thinking about how 2001:A Space Odyssey and Apollo 13 were much better films than Gravity despite their lack of CGI, or perhaps BECAUSE of the lack of CGI! I had empathy  for those characters and feared for them, despite the fact that we already knew how Apollo 13 ended. I had no such investment in Gravity's main character, a bore who seemed to have lost all reason to live.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[6]]<br/>I saw it in 3D - it would be a complete waste of time otherwise as the rest of the film is rather 1D. The script was appalling, in fact, it would have been better without any words at all. The film is the antithesis of 2001 i.e. not existential in the least, hence the final scene. Fortunately, it is a short film (89 minutes). Mind you, if a few other nations had abandoned space stations floating around it could have gone on for hours and Sandra could have instantaneously learnt a few other languages.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[6]]<br/>Plot and dialogue anyone?<br/><br/>The film is excellent at what it is, a ride. But it is so awful everywhere else! I concede the final scene is pretty special. We are all just floating through space.<br/><br/>What happens to her fever and her clumsiness? How could she fail a simulator over and over that requires pressing three buttons and allows mistakes? The third astronaut: a joke. <br/><br/>It is good cinema; the effects are amazing. But rides get boring fast and I don't think this film will stand the test of repeat viewings.<br/><br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[10]]<br/>Gravity is as groundbreaking as 2001 was in its day. The idea that it isn't in the same league is ridiculous. What Strauss's music did for 2001, CGI does for Gravity. Gravity is of a complete magnitude better.<br/><br/>I thought much of the dialogue was annoying but that wasn't enough to render the film bad. Taken in context it is one irritant in a magnificent piece of work. <br/><br/>Gravity is the unbackable favourite for next year's best picture Oscar. Cuaron has changed the paradigm for future scifi movies completely. And Sandra deserves all the plaudits she gets, a solid performance.<br/><br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[9]]<br/>God knows how they funded it; the subject detail, not to mention the sparse dialogue. I'm glad it was funded; this film urges your brain to work, contemplate what is out there and more importantly, who we are. <br/>GeorgeandSandra don't go that far from earth at all. Which is why it's called Gravity. She comes back. We come back. <br/><br/>We are grounded in this beautiful and logical premise - that we belong on this rock. Strange, you might suppose, a space film is about earth ..not space. <br/>Could it be intrinsically, we know we belong here, bound in gravity?</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[9]]<br/>If there's a film to bring us back to earth, back to a reality about what is important in life, this might be it.<br/>Three actors, two A-listers, described as a science fiction space thriller; I was pensive going into this film.<br/>The words science-fiction-space-thriller don't normally evoke images or thoughts of philosophy, religion or introspection.<br/>Gravity does. Alfonso Cuaron is as deliberate with details as he is allegorical about each spiritually-provoking message. A film about Sandra but also about you. It's about evolution, it's about religion (or lack of it), and the fact our universe is devoid of any alien lifeform.</p>

The visuals are stunning and the performances excellent. Clooney is charming and amusing and Bullock is a great action heroine after she has got past the girly bits.<br/>Great music score.<br/>A totally gripping ninety minutes of great entertainment.</p>

I almost got up and walked out after the fourth or so serial calamity to face Sandra Bullock's character.  I was prevented from doing so only by not wanting to disturb others in my row.</p>

Sandra Bullocks  embryonic pose once inside the womb of the capsule was figuratively impressive if intentioned... or was I being too profound?

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[10]]<br/>I think you have to attempt to understand this on a level deeper than just the action taking place to appreciate it fully.  Gravity, to me, is an allegory to the struggle of life itself, and how compassion and the ability to face things with clarity make an enormous difference.  It is an action film - but the action isn't the source of what's most satisfying about it.  Get inside what it would be like as each of the main characters.  It made me feel how fantastic it is to be alive, or give life .. definitely five stars.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[1]]<br/>The CGI was stunning -as you'd expect for any film made in 2013.  But this was far from intelligent filmmaking.  The laws of physics followed one minute and ignored the next.  The daft notion that the Hubble, the ISS and the Chinese station are all within a few kilometres of each other.  The worst thing was a ten minutes story padded out to fill 90 minutes.  We have a couple of cardboard cutout protagonists and a (very) "Bad Day at the Office" plot.  Will she or won't she survive?  Who cares?  A space movie for special effects fans only.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[10]]<br/>I'm going to say the movie isn't scientifically accurate but hey its only a movie and an excellent one at that. Having dreamed of being an astronaut as a child this film mystified me. The suspense kept you on the edge of your seat, the film didn't need multiple settings or long lengthy dialogue. The visuals stunning. I would have preferred to see others take the lead. Sandra going from Ms Congeniality to astronaut is something different. I was hoping George's character would survive. <br/><br/>. This 90 minute thrill ride comes highly recommended</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[9]]<br/>If the scene you were talking about was the 'dream/hallucination'scene - I loved it. The film turned on it. She was a woman in despair, too tired to fight and grieving her daughter, She just wanted to sleep and not wake up.She had hit rock bottom. I thought Sandra Bullock portrayed that scene beautifully. Perhaps it was a bit clunky <br/><br/>Love your show - thank you</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[10]]<br/>This film wasn't intended to be an action packed, intense, plot-driven thriller. It showcases the power of one's survival instinct and their absolute will to live. The scene M&amp;D disliked was brilliant in my opinion, it worked with the plot because it's what Bullock's character needed to continue fighting for her life. The dialogue was realistic and insightful and the camera work was beautifully executed. Go and see this film, but with an open mind, and try to understand the rich meaning behind the plot which emotively showcases what it means to be alive and how valuable it truly is.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[10]]<br/>An incredible film.  I was totally transported and immersed in this spectacular 3D visual experience.  Sandra Bullock was fantastic. When so many less impressive films overstay their welcome and drag on for two and a half hours, this tight 90 minute film pitches just right.  A film you must see, and must see it in 3D no matter what.</p>

As if a non astronaut could move from craft to craft and fly them without lots of very specific training and knowledge of Chinese and Russian language. These is no air in space to tear parts off a moving spacecraft. 1 1/2 is too much.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[0]]<br/>I am still numbed by this woeful film. I am also stupefied by how many reviewers can give this movie 5 stars. Thousands of pieces of space debris flies past Bullock and Clooney and they all miss. Vodka in the Russian craft. Silly jokes. Amateur philosophies of life. Smitten exchanges about beautiful eyes you have when you are facing death. Relentlessly lame. The last scene where Bullock reaches Earth and grabs the sand on the beach is hopeless acting. Probably many patrons crying with relief at this moment who took this seriously.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[2]]<br/>Besides the special effects, which everyone agrees is amazing, the storyline is rubbish. Casting poor. What would anybody like Sandra Bullocks character be doing up there to begin with. She didn't know what she was doing most of the time. A trained astronaut wouldn't be such a bimbo. Maybe if they casted better, Sandra's character would be more plausible. <br/><br/>The scene that Margaret and Dave didn't like, I actually liked. It gave the storyline a little depth. If it didn't have that it would really lack anything but a special effects demo.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[2]]<br/>Spectacular visuals, and a fantastic impression of weightlessness. But it's no successor to 2001, nor even Avatar.<br/><br/>I found George Clooney's incessant clowning around irritating and unrealistic. Astronauts don't muck around like that - they're serious and focused, like the ones in 2001. In real life, Clooney wouldn't have made it past the first psych test.<br/><br/>The storyline could also have been a lot more thought provoking, but unfortunately the director went for the Hollywood 'serial disaster' style. As for the ending, the less said the better.<br/><br/>Should have stayed home and saved my money.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[8]]<br/>A tense cinematic ride.  To me, people asking for different things out of the plot are largely asking the movie to perform functions it simply isn't interested in performing.<br/><br/>This isn't a film about issues, or character development.  It's a film designed to put you in space and give you a sense of how disorienting, dangerous and lonely it is.<br/><br/>And it does that VERY well. I found myself thinking, before the script specifically addressed the point, that if it were me I would want to simply give up and say "this is it, I'm going to die".</p>

Beautifully shot, amazing special effects, atmospheric sound track, Curaon's vision for this film was outstanding! I want to see it again as I'm sure I missed some of the finer detail. Has to be an Oscar contender. Only negative was George's rather small somewhat underdeveloped part hence my rating is short one half star.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[8]]<br/>This one of the few space sci fi type films that depends on special effects to work that I have enjoyed.  The special effects are so good you forget about them.  3D does add to the impression.  The storyline is a bit far fetched and I agree with the reviewer below about the ending, but the total package is so engaging that I overlooked some of the clunky dialogue and woodenness that creeps in at times.  They are astronauts, highly trained in that field, not playwrights or gifted speechmakers after all.  It had the whole cinema holding its collective breath.</p>

You just know that whatever happens it'll eventually be allright.  When the spaceship's window is opened for the last time people laughed out loud at the result. I groaned at the footprints in the sand.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[9]]<br/>The thing that polarises the comments about this film is that it is not your usual complicated, sting in the tail type of film. A lot of people I know say the story line was terrible. I disagree. The story line was basic, logical and reflected the desperation of the situation.<br/><br/>Stunning effects, claustrophobia and agoraphobia at the same time. Great!<br/><br/>Not many films make me hold my breath but this one did. Don't be put off by the negative reviews. See it for yourself and see it in 3-D.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[6]]<br/>Alfonso Cuaron had a vision with Gravity. His vision was to transport us, the viewer, to a place we can only dream of ever getting to . I was transfixed with the 3D experience and it was great to see our planet "Earth" in that dimension. His vision worked extremely well with his directing, the cinematography, production design, art direction, set decoration,  costume design, makeup and music by Steven Price, which came to a mighty climax at one stage of the film, were all extremely well produced. The downfall with the director's vision is the thin screenplay and 2 leads.</p>

Despite that most of the science was accurate. I'm guessing that the scene that annoyed some people was the return of the Cluny character. The Bullock character was at the point of death, low on oxygen, Hey folks, every heard of hallucinations?<br/>I totally identified with the character. I will see it again.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[9]]<br/>Wow! Absolutely fantastic. No sex. No violence. No foul language. Just great direction, and cinematography, and special effects. Given the very simple plot, Sandra B did a excellent job.  Sure, some of the dialogue was a bit trite, but have you ever listened to the moon landing broadcasts! This is a parody on the myriad of banal "right stuff" movies but with a touch of pizazz. It  is pure edge-of-the-seat entertainment which is what movies should be all about. A "must see" - but definitely in 3D for the full experience.</p>

Why the hell has Margaret given it 4.5 and David 4???<br/><br/>Its nothing more than a showcase for the special effects which I will admit are fantastic.<br/><br/>Sandar Bullock is a terrible actress. Shes the same in every move. Totally unconvincing. Its Miss Congeniality in space.<br/><br/>The subplot about her fear of being alone and her daughter etc had me reaching for the sick bag in the first ten minutes.  <br/>How the hell this is being called movie of the year Ill never know.  <br/>Utterly disappointing.        <br/><br/></p>

The plot is utterly laughable despite genuine occasional tension.

It was clammy hands stuff from start to finish.<br/><br/>However, a movie of over 1 hour needs more than visuals and suspense. Disgraceful script made Clooney's character a boring dill and Bullock's character, NASA's token female. Stupid!!<br/><br/>Also annoying to see the typical Hollywood affect. The plot (for want of a better word) screams for a prequel and sequel.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[10]]<br/>Wonderful film in the real sense (just got home from it). 90 minutes of absolute gripping cinematic art. The laconic characters were critical to the tone and the space-ness of the movie (think Keir Dullea 2001) Absolute immersive experience and couldn't tear my eyes away from it for a second - can't recall ever having done that in a movie.  Sandra Bullock was just magnificent, and I can't think of any other female actor who could do that role.I had plenty of empathy for the characters and got to know a lot about both (disagree w posters below).</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[4]]<br/>The worth of this film lies in the clever imagery and sense of being in space. That was good. As for a the story, very shallow. The viewer never really gets to know the characters, so no empathy. The most interesting character  (at least with a sense of humor) doesn't last long. Its an unbelievable sort-of-an-action movie, unrelenting, with none of the cleverness or tension of astronaut verse computer as in 2001. Should not be compared to 2001, no where near it.</p>

You go 'wow' for a second and then you sink back to boredom. Sandra Bullock really flexes her limited emotional range due, no less, to her multiple facelifts and Botox. How is it that she looks younger in "Gravity" then she did in "Speed" almost 20 years ago?</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[9]]<br/>Forget all the negatives. That's a cop out. Name one movie without them. Rather, see it for what it is - a truly cinematographic triumph, marvel  and wonder. Simply stunning.  Importantly, it is a fitting tribute and testimony to the ingenuity of filmmakers who never fail to transport audiences into unimaginable places and situations far beyond the somewhat ordinary life experiences of most earthlings. We came away asking "how did they do that?"  Put simply, we went to be entertained and enthralled and were not disappointed.  More "glass half full" than some, perhaps?</p>

The visuals and special effects, whilst stunning, dragged on.  And the implausibility of so much of it. <br/>DUD!<br/>Kubrick's 2001, made all those years ago (1968), is still the stand out.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[0]]<br/>Interesting how people seem to be polarised you either love it or hate it. For me it was woeful. The plot was totally implausible, the characters totally non developed. The dialogue was atrocious, the characters were stereotyped. The Martian floating through the ruined space station purlease....lack of research evident</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[9]]<br/>The whole movie a metaphor for life. Clooney's Buzz Lightyear character was like an angel of optimisim. Sandra the damaged goods, learning to let go and make a decision to overcome, move forward and live life without fear. It is the story of all of our lives. To face and evolve. I loved the scene where she looked like a baby floating in the womb, and her Re-birth at the end coming out of the water. Very cleverly done. I hope it touches more people who would not usually think about these things.  Don't you get it?? It's so obvious!</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[10]]<br/>I cannot believe what people are saying i.e. that the movie is unbelievable. You go to see space monsters sometimes! For God's sake, it's a movie! It isn't a documentary. Who the hell cares if it stretches the truth. <br/><br/>And as for 'the scene' that wasn't liked by Margaret and David. I have NO idea which scene it was, it all fitted together brilliantly.<br/><br/>I thought this moves was AWESOME! I loved every moment of it. Will watch this one over and over just for the sheer joy of floating around in space; of actually being there WITH them. Wonderful!</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[5]]<br/>Agree with comments re:clunky script.  In reality, anyone being sent into space will know talking uses O2, how to slow your heart rate and the danger of fire in a small space full of the only O2 around. You would put it out, not just float on past. At times unbelievable. <br/><br/>Clooney was fabulous in his "the right stuff" mode.  Great visuals which I loved and the impact of the whole stranded in space with our home, planet Earth, so difficult to get back to etc.  Enjoyed the emotion and touch of the spiritual if you suspend logic.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[6]]<br/>The 3 stars are for the special effects and visuals. The rest gets nothing - extremely boring. This has to be the most banal dialogue I have ever experienced in a movie. It's almost as if they needed to come up with something for the actors to say to fill in time. All the actors were unconvincing, and I'm sure the feminists are fuming - the female character was bumbling and only got things done with the help of the knowledgeable male. I'm sure the NASA people will get a good laugh from this one!</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[10]]<br/>I would like to know what scene they were talking about too.  I think it could be one of three - the dog howling, clooney's last scene or the water bit at the end?<br/><br/>Over all I was totally absorbed and went along with the ride.  I got a lot more from it then expected and left thinking about humanity and the need to survive and just keep going.  Even when you have nothing much to live for.  I appreciated the director was able to convey all that without needing to shove it in your face.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[4]]<br/>Let's get it out of the way- "visually stunning 3-D useage"- couldnt agree more. But that can only get a film so far. Story-line- typical Hollywood maudlin crapola,  casting- ridiculously bad- Clooney doing Clooney stuff, just in space,I couldnt stop thinking of Buzz Lightyear and Bullock, where to start.... she has to be the worst major film 'actor' of the past two decades- she does the same underwhelmed and underwhelming character in every film. That voice... I went with hope that this film could rise above these 2 but Hollywood gets what Hollywood wants! BIG NAMES! BIG DISAPPOINTMENT</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[5]]<br/>I went into Gravity after hearing the hype and good reports from friends. I left somewhat underwhelmed. I struggled to believe the plausibility of such a sequence of events for Bullocks character nor did I care enough about the characters to be moved. So much talk of the 'edge of your seat' factor yet I felt very little of this. The outcome was obvious from 1/3 of the way through and in true Hollywood form everything worked out in the end. Great concept and implementation though. Still a somewhat brave film in today's environment regardless of my personal experience.</p>

Either the 3D glasses were complete crap or the 3Dness was complete crap but it spoilt the movie for me the 3D bit was SO poor.<br/><br/>However this movie is utterly spectacular. It's a trip and a half. I noticed the music more this time. Definitely Oscar material; the whole thing is. Right up there with my two favorite movies of all time: Sound of Music and Apollo 13.

"' out of this world" !!. I do recall an interview with Sandra Bullock, recently, when she was  asked if she would ever like to venture into space, and she emphatically replied, No Way!! .It is easy to nit pick, but the merits of this production far outweigh any perceived flaws.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[8]]<br/>Neither reviewer picked up the major scientific error in this film : the scene where Bullock is trailing the Space station feet tangled in chords &amp; Clooney hanging on to her. This scene contravenes Newton's laws as for this to be true the space station would have to be accelerating away from them at a great rate, which is evidently was not, instead being in a steady orbit.<br/>This error more than slightly detroyed my enjoyment of this film , which was otherwise excellent. Such sci-fi films are likely to attract people of a scientific bent such as myself.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[7]]<br/>Visually stunning but for me the story was bland - but then maybe it is difficult to build much of a story when there are only two outcomes possible and two (and then one -surprise!) characters to work with.  Predictability isn't necessarily fatal to enjoying a movie if there is enough character development, subtlety of performance and twists and turns on the journey to the known end - we all knew what was going to happen in Argo and The King'sSpeech. For me, that just wasn't there in Gravity.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[8]]<br/>Loved this film. An edge of seat thriller. Visually fantastic.  However, the casting of such well known people was a distraction from some of the tension. The tone in Sandra Bullock's voice as she gasped and laboured through space is the same tone that we hear as she falls out the window in '28 Days'! The casting of little known or unknown actors in these roles would have allowed deeper absorption into the film's brilliant atmospherics and greater empathy for the desperate plight of the protagonist/s. The best sci-fi film since 2001 is 'Moon'.</p>

To capture that feeling of weightlessness and the feeling of being utterly lost is incredible.  <br/><br/>That 'clunky' scene in the second half in that reappearance scene was a flight of imagination and fitted the film.

After the first admittedly very good 20 minutes, the film is plagued with cheesy hollywood cliche's and unnecessary dialogue. The plot is tedious when existent and the characters are annoying and 1 dimensional. Why this film classifies as a sci fi is beyond me, there is no imagination in sight.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[8]]<br/>Gravity is a fast paced  astronaut survival  genre movie. George Clooney and Sandra Bullock ably  play the roles of 2  marooned  astronauts who  are  castaway due to  a catastrophic  Russian anti satellite  missile test.  . <br/><br/>Gravity's  3D visuals  are  sensational. Whilst the movie  has overdone and   cheezy dialogue,   audiences might wonder  whether there was much choice in this. From a screenwriters perspective,    alternative dialogues might well have turned out  too melodramatic -  surely  a greater sin in the scheme of things.<br/><br/>Gravity ends with a scene that has an historic parallel from   NASA's  Mercury Redstone 4 mission from  the early 1960s.<br/><br/></p>

The SFX was yes, out-of-this world (pun unintended). However, the dialogue was appalling and cliche. I could see this script being written.<br/>The lowest point for me was when Clooney released his life line cord from Bullock, which was an act of suicide followed by a casual line from him "admit it, you found me attractive".</p>

Problem is: Since this movie is about the visual experience, it shouldn't be viewed in any format but 3D. Saw it in a packed cinema with no 3D and the audience was left laughing.  The script had no where to hide. When Sandra Bullock said, "I really hate space", there was an audible groan and rolling of eyes. For me... it was just ... wow... bad...</p>

But why can't these directors employ decent script writers? !  This plot ended up being so implausible that  the movie needs to be classified as a sci-fiction comedy. Poor Sandra Bullock must have spent most of her time laughing her way through the scenes given the ridiculous antics she was forced to perform.  And what can one say about the wonder women ending.  God bless America.  Oh yes, thanks once again George for your cameo.</p>

Agree about the less than wonderful dialogue, and Clooney was too cheesy by half, but the effects were out of this world (sorry). It's hard to believe it wasn't shot in orbit. After watching Sharknado the other day I reckon I've experienced the high and the low of modern-day special effects movies, never mind the plots.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[10]]<br/>Thought of Matt more as a figment of Ryan's imagination, a kind of stronghold - who would act that way? Still, a nice contrast. I thought the scene where Clooney detaches was worse than any other - antithetical to the kind of instincts Bullock displayed. A needed plot-line? All the other cheese - to be expected (an American film!)... By the end I was floored, near tears. Sat through the credits motionless, even discussed te film with a stranger afterward - a first for me. Sensational music. In my mind not a sci-fi at all, more a humanitarian tale.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[4]]<br/>Atrocious dialogue and cliches.  Found it tiresome rather than gripping.  Nice to look at but perhaps too heavy and weighed down by its own gravity (importance) to be anywhere near approaching 'masterpiece'. If science fiction is about 'identity' perhaps I was trying too hard to understand the emotional subtexts and should have simply gone along for the ride, but that would have required turning off my brain!  And thus I should have been able to forgive Captain Clooney's abysmal performance and be less cynical... but sadly I was unimpressed.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[10]]<br/>I drifted away watching this exceptional film. It will no doubt win the most Oscars even if it is just all the technical and FX awards. It's also a great achievement in Directing and Alfonso Cuaron will be best remembered for this masterpiece. I actually found the screenplay quite believable and conversation naturally boring  similar to 2001 : A Space Odyssey/Solaris . <br/><br/>Film also left a few questions about Clooney was he real or a figment imagination ,Bollock in the Foetal position was interesting also <br/><br/>A landmark for this generation.  Masterpiece 5 stars and beyond</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[4]]<br/>Definitely not the best space film since 2001 a space odyssey. I was impressed with the cinematography and high tech aspects of the film. BUT the dialogoue was very clunky and overall the film became a vehicle for sandra bullock. After endless problems getting back to earth, sandra finally makes it to shore on earth. What no alligators or crocodiles sitting on land waiting for her? How disappointing!!!</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[6]]<br/>The cinematography is certainly outstanding and the 3D does enhance. The Russian bashing was gratuitous. A defective American spy satellite was destroyed on February 21, 2008 by a missile fired from the USS Lake Erie, something the Chinese have also done but not the Russians. This film panders to an adolescent male audience, which Kubrick's masterpiece most certainly did not.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[10]]<br/>This film really is beat perfect. Sure, you can find fault with things such as plot and characterisation, but in the final analysis this is a director's film which is technically breathtaking, and that's what matters. David, please don't use some fools' laughter to help make your case that the scene with Ryan's emotional extremes in the Russian escape capsule was not up to par. The scene actually sets up the finale perfectly. Sometimes you and Margaret seem jaded, I'm afraid. My only quibble is with Sandra Bullock's adequate performance. In contrast, Cate Blanchett would have been just perfect.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[9]]<br/>Don't read this film as plausible fiction. It's a parable on choosing to live after adversity. Which is why the 'scene' that M&amp;D refer to is essential and the film would make very little sense without it. Incredibly shot and perfect length (short). The quotations to 2001, Barbarella and even Wall-E are interesting for cinema lovers. Normally I avoid 3D but this one really is spectacular. This film by Alfonso Cuaron is....dare I say it.....his masterpiece.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[6]]<br/>2001 David. I don't think so. Outsanding special effects and I did think Sandra Bullock was excellent. Also saw Blue Jasmine over the weekend and I believe Cate Blanchett's performance is a class above Sandra Bullocks this year. Where it falls down is the script. Pretty lightweight. It could have been a lot better. Poor casting of George Clooney. I like George in many of his movies. A little known actor would have been better for this part. He distracted from the character he was playing. Worth seeing for the visuals.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[7]]<br/>Personally, it's not that special. It has some amazing special effects, but that doesn't equal a rewarding experience. The film is actually the opposite of rewarding in the thought-provoking sense. Nothing about it is deep. Besides the obvious positivity towards the visuals which are often realistic and dizzying, there's no real reason to get excited because there's nothing here that constitutes rich storytelling. It's all about basic survival, but the story won't blow you away. The script/plot is severely underwhelming. Still, the movie is a good length and it does play on a few fears you may harbour.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[8]]<br/>Very good.  Great to look at.  Simple plot, two actors, minimal dialogue.  And so potent.  The infinite vastness of the universe, the beauty of Earth, and the place of humans.  The isolation, the quest for survival, and the impossibility to conquer any of that vast space out there.  We can be very technically savvy but we are powerless and defenseless against nature, particularly that nature above our heads.  Makes it into my list of space movies: 1) 2001, 2) Solaris (Tarkovsky), 3) Alien, Moon, Apollo 13, Gravity (can't decide the order).  See it in 3D on the biggest screen.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[6]]<br/>Truly spectacular visually, with great use of 3D, but oh so lame in the "believablity" department, which is a great pity.  The Sandra Bullock character would never , ever have been sent on a space mission with her "what does this button do ?"  approach.  Predictable , corny  and dumb dialogue, and the requirement to constantly suspend your disbelief made me wish this film had been more realistic and foregone the happy ending . Could have been great , but somehow manages just to grate.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[8]]<br/>I saw the trailer and didn't think much about it.  Then heard a couple of reviews and it made me interested.  I thought the direction of it was brilliant.  Those long shots were amazing.  And it really held the suspense. Great film.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[10]]<br/>OUTSTANDING<br/>the best cinematic experience I've ever had. this film is truly remarkable. The 3D effects are so immersive and the score works perfectly with what's taking pace before your eyes. <br/><br/>Really enjoyed Sandra Bullock, she added the human dimension to the film and really sold the whole film as an allegory for life itself. Watching Ryan journey throughout the film no just to survive, but to 'live', all in the majesty of space almost makes you realise how precious life really is. I found it to be quite inspirational, without it feeling forced or preachy. Bravo Cuaron <br/><br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[9]]<br/>I must disagree with David's remarks about Sandra Bullock's closing dialogue as being "corny sentiments". Freud observed that people in extremes of stress revert to a more infantile state where they were more comfortable. As an obstetrician I have seen it from time to time in labours proving unbelievably stressful to that woman. Why, I have seen tertiary-educated women in labour regress to a more infantile state where they start to speak like a child, "Mummy, Mummy", start sucking their thumb, etc. So I found her dialogue totally appropriate in those closing stages.<br/><br/>Special effects Oscar - lay down misere.<br/></p>

The ambient score really nailed the feeling of empty space, while also pushing you even further to the edge of your seat.    A few lines of poor dialogue, and cliche moments are quickly swept aside in a torrent of amazing film making.  Do your self a favor and see it on the biggest 3D screen you can find.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[8]]<br/>Yes, The visual effects were spectacular and inspiring, however I was driven to distraction by the inane dialogue. The film could have been perfect with a better script and the story much more profound. I enjoyed Sandra Bullock's performance and the nod to Sigourney in Alien with one particularly beautiful scene. Will definitely see the 3D version and would love to see a "Making of" documentary when the DVD version is released.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[9]]<br/>The glowing comments about the 3D technology and incredible cinematography are all justified. However, I  feel the skill of the filmmakers in creating such gripping tension over an extended period with only two (mostly one) actor onscreen is completely under-rated. They did a first class job. David, if the dialog you disliked was the one in the style of a "weather forecast" - then I agree with you. It was out of character given the perilous situation the character was in at that precise moment. But THAT was the only slight blemish. It didn't matter. Brilliant!</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[7]]<br/>Gravity isn't quite the overall 'out of this world' experience to me, however there are several outstanding cinematic qualities that make Gravity as good as it is and worthy of most Oscar nominations in its trajectory. Let's start with the creative, innovative shooting of the picture which lets us witness the beauty and the peril of life in space from many perspectives. The production design, visuals &amp; sound, everything has been meticulously designed to such realistic, awe-inspiring effect. Performances are tops, it's tight &amp; tense for the full 90 minutes. Now, I only wish I saw this in 3D.</p>

You must see it on a huge screen and in 3D<br/>The opening sequence is fantastic, and the film is really at its most effective when there is absolutely no sound. I agree the film could have been a masterpiece except for some of the corny dialogue and, yes - THAT scene about two thirds of the way through which I thought was ridiculous.<br/>Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are fine and the effects are fantastic.<br/>It's no 20001 but overall an amazing experience.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[10]]<br/>Blown away by this film as I have not been in a film for quite a while. Had no problem with that very domestic radio connection. I worked in Antarctica many years years ago and it was not uncommon for odd atmospherics to put you in touch with the most unexpected users and thematically I feel it enhanced her isolation beautifully, it brought a tear to my eye.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[9]]<br/>Amazing from start to finish. Those first scenes are dizzingly stunning. The scene at the ISS also brilliant. Lots of clutching my seat at times. Not entirely sure which scene David thought didn't work, tho I think I can guess, and if so, I didn't think it was that bad. Script a little bland, but don't think you're going to see this for dialogue... A must see</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[9]]<br/>Extraordinarily intense, but also extraordinarily engaging - this is one of the best (and most beautiful) movies of 2013 so far. <br/><br/>So close to a perfect 5, the only real noticeable problem for me was the extremely awkward expository dialogue in the earlier scenes... but with maybe one more draft of the screenplay, Gravity could have been a modern masterpiece</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[9]]<br/>Thoroughly enjoyed Gravity, it certainly did not disappoint. It wasn't what I expected, which is fantastic and isn't that what good movie making is all about. Edge of your seat stuff - no laughing in the second half or at all when I saw it. Deeply moving, amazing footage, and incredible acting especially from Sandra. Will see again on the biggest screen possible.</p>

<p class="comment">((Gravity))[[9]]<br/>See this on the biggest screen possible and in 3D. The film is utterly compelling and should be there in the awards season. The photography, the score and the actors are amazing. Alfonso Cuaron has brought off the impossible-a two hander with no monsters or villians and very little profanity.  I thought that the scene referred to by M&amp;D was a tension breaker, nothing more. It didn't spoil the film for me. Brilliant.,</p>
