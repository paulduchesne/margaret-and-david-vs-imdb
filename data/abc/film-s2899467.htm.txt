<h2>Animal Kingdom</h2>
<p class="ratd"> Rated <em>MA</em></p>
<p><em>Review by David Stratton</em></p>
<p>And now to our next film ANIMAL KINGDOM. When the mother of Josh, JAMES FRECHEVILLE, dies of an overdose the teenager has nowhere to go but to the home of the grandmother he hardly knows. Janine, known as Smurf (JACKI WEAVER) welcomes her grandson, and he soon meets members of this criminal group - Baz, JOEL EDGERTON, who is thinking of giving up a life of crime; and J's uncles, Pope, BEN MENDELSOHN, just out of prison and lying low; Darren, LUKE FORD who is quiet and withdrawn; and Craig, SULLIVAN STAPLETON, an unstable dealer and user....<br/><br/>When one of the clan is killed by a pair of cops and Pope takes revenge, Josh is drawn into the family web of crime. Meanwhile a police officer, Leckie, GUY PEARCE, is putting the screws on the Cody clan...<br/><br/>Writer-director David Michod, after his award-winning short film, CROSSBOW, makes a most auspicious feature debut with ANIMAL KINGDOM, a suspenseful, enthralling study of the disintegration of a family of criminals. As we're introduced to the Cody's through the innocent Josh, we discover not only a quartet of drug-dealing criminal brothers and their friend, but also, in Smurf, a matriarch who will do anything - anything at all - to protect her sons. <br/><br/>The revelation here is JACKI WEAVER, always a fine actor but seldom revealing the depths of character she does here. All the performances are superb, down to the small parts - like DAN WYLLIE as the family's lawyer and ANNA LISA PHILLIPS as Josh's barrister. The film is also really well shot, by Adam Arkapaw, and edited, by Luke Doolan.<br/><br/>ANIMAL KINGDOM deservedly won the World Cinema Jury prize at Sundance earlier this year, and confirms that Michod is an important new talent.</p>
<h2>Further comments</h2>
<p>DAVID: Margaret?<br/><br/>MARGARET: Isn't he though? <br/><br/>DAVID: Really good.<br/><br/>MARGARET: I just - when I saw that film and it came from Sundance you go, "Oh, well, maybe it's Australian newness or something. But this is - David Michod is a man in charge of his medium in this and you didn't mention Antony Partos's music and...<br/><br/>DAVID: No, the music's very good, too.<br/><br/>MARGARET: ...and the music is such an informing aspect of this film. I really loved it and I'm not a person that embraces this sort of story. I'm not into the underbelly of our cities so much but I just loved the world that was presented here and how it was presented.<br/><br/>DAVID: Because it's so intelligent and so...<br/><br/>MARGARET: Yes.<br/><br/>DAVID: It's really, really well done. After SEX AND THE CITY 2, I wanted to give the...<br/><br/>MARGARET: Oh, give up on that. Hello!<br/><br/>DAVID: After SEX AND THE CITY 2, I just wanted to give the game away, but then I see something like this, and it restores my faith in film. This is what cinema is all about. This kind of really good film.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Well, thank God I can recognise it, David.<br/><br/>DAVID: Yes.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Aren't you relieved? <br/><br/>DAVID: I am.<br/><br/>MARGARET: But I was also impressed by James Frecheville. I hadn't seen him before and he - it seems like such a minimalist performance put it's fantastic. I'm giving this four and a half stars. <br/><br/>DAVID: It's so lovely to see a really good Australian film. And we're not admiring this because it's an Australian film, because it's a very good film. Four and a half stars from me, too.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[10]]<br>Watched again last nite. Superb. Poor David M. How can he ever hope to match this superb movie. Jackie W great, but cannot understand how Ben M didn't score a BSA nomination. In fact, if this had been a Hollywood film, wld have scored a whole bunch of other nominations - BF, BD, BS at the very least. Incredibly moving, emotional &amp; shocking in places. All this without CGI, special effects, over the top acting. Displaces Devils Playground as my favorite film.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[9]]<br>I very much enjoyed this when it came out and I saw it at the movies. Now that I've watched Wish You Were Here I'm looking forward to revisiting it. I've lived in places where people like this hide out and it's not as far fetched as people might think. Great opening credits, and a super cast with Jackie Weaver as the disturbing mother and grandmother. James Frechville  was fabulous as Josh and his uncle Pope played by my ex-husband's look-alike was a convincing menace. If you missed it on release go the DVD this weekend and enjoy.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[8]]<br>Loved it. I haven't seen every film ever made to be sure but i haven't seen a crime film like this before. It strikes me as very original. Beautifully made. Wonderful performances. The mindlessness of killing the girlfriend is totally believable and adds a powerful twist to the story. I can see this film is too subtle for a lot of viewers. Too bad for them.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[3]]<br>THE GOOD:<br>Great cast. Solid acting esp. Frecheville. <br><br>THE BAD:<br>Pretty much everything else. It had potential but failed. Long. Boring. Unlikeable characters. Predictable ending. Kept waiting for something to happen. It never did. Terrible script and directing. The actors had nothing to work with. I thought a section of the film was missing and had to rewind to make sure I didn't miss something. I didn't. Director trying to be too artsy. Can't believe all the 4 and 5 stars, incl D &amp; M. Really terrible Australian film.</br></br></br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[4]]<br>I'll give it two stars for the first half which was excellent.  (Plot spoiler) Once the young girl is murdered however, it just goes too far over the top.  In a word?  Overrated!  So annoying when noone is interested in my script which I believe is better and would be far more entertaining.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[9]]<br>To this day I'm still so proud of this film. Michod has modernised the crime genre and turned it into something that leaves room for interpretation. The ensemble cast is unforgettable and leave have the ability to leave a unique imprint on you; whether it be Weaver's chilling smile, Mendolsohn's twisted mind or Frencheville's honesty. A near perfect film and something Australia should be really proud of.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[5]]<br>Idiot Box and The Boys far exceed this attempt at portraying Australia's "surburban" criminals. Good performances generally but let down by a sloppy storyline, and a lazy script, hardly gripping cinema here. Needs to have more than a catchy title and a prominent aussie cast to be a success. I was looking forward to reading DS and MP review, but 4.5 stars...are you kidding?</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[5]]<br>Now if they showed the full story of what made that family the way it was, now that would of been more inficiating than scareface times 10 . thats only two percent of the story and hey a life is a life.Its probably a story best kept in the realm of legend its to strong for a movie and you would of had to be there or be close to even come near producing it wright. better luck next time when everyone is long gone and noone can be hurt.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[10]]<br>I hate to say it but I am not a lover of Aussie television at all and it takes something good for me to enjoy Aussie cinema...and here it is. Powerhouse perfromances from all of the actors, especially Frecheville and Weaver. I don't like the Underbelly franchise but this was intelligent, gritty, psychologically real with a brilliant screenplay. The music was also perfect it never intruded but set the tone the way a good score should. See this movie if you like psychological not just violenvce for the sake of it.</br></p>

Acting was OK but if Jackie Weaver gets an award for anything then I'll be entering next year "At the beach with Uncle Arthur".<br>Story line was boring, acting was pretty good, actually, but didn't make up for two hours of wondering when something was going to happen.<br>And the ending - seemed like the production crew had just got so bored with what was in the can so far, they just decided to slap on the ending credits.<br>I agree with David "It's so lovely to see an Australian Film".

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[2]]<br>This was so disappointing. It needed much more character and plot development, and some interesting dialogue. Long pauses, staring off into space and minimal dialogue do not  lift this superficial and tedious film. There were lots of good actors but that didn't help. To suggest that Jackie Weaver might get an Oscar for 2 mins on screen as a mildly interesting crazy with an unconvincing interest in almost pashing her sons is just silly.</br></p>

And James Frecheville getting nods at the AFI? My invisible pet dog has more talent than he has</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[10]]<br>A superb Australian film that we don't have to make any excuses for. Something that happens far too often, even from our better critics. It doesn't miss a beat and the music is superb. Such a change from the overblown formulaic scoring that is clogging up most films these days.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[2]]<br>This is an awful movie in most respects. The characters are completely one dimensional and so unlikable. A family of sociopaths still needs at least something else to make it vaguely interesting. The whole thing was just depressing. <br>I can see why David and Margaret might give it such a good review but I totally disagree and when you look harder it just misses the mark. I watched it 3 times to be sure and I am convinced it is as bad as I think, I will wave my flag somewhere else.<br/></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[3]]<br/>Did not like this film at all.  The whole thing was totally grim and had no redemption at the end.  No humour either, and the script was so spare, the character development so poor, that I could not feel any empathy for any of the characters, including the central figure J.  The only bit that grabbed me was when the Jackie Weaver character tried to bargain with the police to save her sons, which was a shocking betrayal.  Why would Guy Pearce and Joel Edgerton bother to take part in such mediocrity?</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[3]]<br/>Vastly over-rated film. While there was strong acting from its principal actors especially Jacki Weaver, where it fell down was its distinct lack of pace or tension. By the first 50 minutes I felt like it was over 2 hours as i was waiting for what was happening next? At this point I gave up. For a more menacing film give me The Boys anyday.</p>

To me it was more a study into a whole class of people that do exist in suburbia all over australia. Pope is the extreme of course, but these people do exist, I have known people like it. <br/>the actor who Portrayed J did a 17 year boy from the wrong tracks, scared and alone very well His deadpan demeanour added to the tension for everyone,the police, his family and us.<br/>Ben M terriffic as the creepy untrustworthy scary uncle.<br/>Best movie Australian or otherwise have seen in ages.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[10]]<br/>An absolutely stunning film, extremely well made and probably my favourite film of the year so far. With brilliant direction, wiriting and cinematography I think this easily one of the best Australian films of the last ten years. I saw it twice in the cinema, and picked up on many of the cleverly placed subtleties behind the violence, and I will certainly see it again!</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[2]]<br/>I found it a thoroughly boring movie with no redeeming features. I couldn't wait for it to finish, or for all of the characters to be killed. The plot was downhill all the way and I desperately waited for something to give me hope for any these people, or to take me beyond the everyday. More than one or two dimensions in the plot would have helped. Some of the acting was very good but the writer needed to give us something or someone to engage with. It may be true-to-life, but it certainly didn't entertain me.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[9]]<br/>Brilliant film. All of the good points of the film have been covered by other reviewers, so I will mainly point out the negatives. First, acting was some of the best in an Australian film. All characters were terrifiic.  Although sometimes the music went on a little longer than it should of, I don't like it when they go all 'hollywood' and sometimes the main character jay seemed to only have 1 facial expression. Other than that bloody brilliant!!</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[9]]<br/>Jonathan Brown meets Matt Day. Animal Kingdom is a magnificent mood piece.And the mood's the thing...dark...dingy..Aussie suburban crime-land.The people who criticise this sort of film seem to want their film going like their burgers...all the same..neatly packaged...with little-or-no flavour......The film's psychological intensity has stayed with me for days...Jackie Weaver's performance is Oscar calibre...Ben Mendelsohn...the coiled spring at the heart of the film has never been better or more revelatory as an actor..The sparse dialogue felt real too...No Tarantino/Scorcese-esque witty smart arsery...but seemingly the way the second or third tier criminal underclass in this country would sound.</p>

This is a marvellous piece of storytelling and the actors, one and all, were superb.  So pleased with Jacki Weaver, her work gets better and better and I was so pleased that she had the chance to play such a deep character.

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[8]]<br/>I loved this film despite it's niggling flaws. It won't be everybody's cup of tea but that's ok. Jackie Weaver was outstanding in a role that left me shivering.  To the reviewers below who slagged it off and offered up Samson and Delilah as the benchmark for aussie films, I say get a grip. S and D was nothing more than a titillating snapshot of boring life on the fringe of society, well acted mind you but a bit like having a tooth out.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[8]]<br/>This is a film that has the influence of a complex Shakespearean tragedy all over it. The intelligent swagger of the film is accompanied by a powerful, yet not overbearing score, an array of uncontrived Australian nuances, and stirling performances from all of the cast. <br/>Special mention goes to James Frecheville for a very measured, and skillfully executed performance.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[10]]<br/>Animal Kingdom is, as far as I'm concerned the best Australian film in ten years. The direction, the locations, the writing, the photography, and the outstanding film score added up to one 'ell of a great film- aided by some of the best acting we have seen (ever) in an Australian film- Jacki Weaver's perfomance was chilling, once we realized what she was about! Well done also to Jame Frencheville, an outstanding effort. Also Ben Mendelsohn has never been better!</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[7]]<br/>Although they would deny it, Margaret and David are up to their old trick of overrating Australian films. As a rule of thumb you can always take a star off their assessment of any Australian film. Having said that, the performances in this movie were excellent throughout but it's familiar story of people I would prefer to spend no time at all with. Three and a half stars from me.</p>

Never have i been so nervous and tense while watching a film, the score, acting and directing is just compelling and creates an extreme atmosphere, on par with the excellent No Country For Old Men. Better yet this film was shot and set in Melbourne where most Aussie movies fail in having interesting landscapes this showed Australia in an inspiring new light. I guess it is "a crazy world" indeed.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[6]]<br/>Plot and story are just as important as acting performances and cinematography. David and Margaret, have you forgotten that. There were many moments when this film stretched credibility and was even naive in what was overlooked or seemingly ignored. I agree that the central performances are superb, but the screenplay, for me, lacked polish and consistency. For a film that wants to be in the genre of gritty realism, it lacked believablility. <br/><br/>Moreover, I did not find the universal themes and the humanity that could have been there. It was stark but all at one level.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[8]]<br/>I wasn't sure what to expect from this film, and although it's not the sort of movie I would typically see, I thought it was very well made. The acting is terrific- Ben Mendelsohn was brilliant as Pope, who seemed to veer between excessive friendliness ("you can always talk to me") and unhinged violence. I wasn't 100% sold on James Frecheville, although given the talent of the other actors, I guess it wasn't surprising that he came across as mediocre. But well worth seeing.</p>

Crime movies shouldn't have violence like all of the time, they need dialogue to bring out a huge balance of the story. I think the dialogue was scary and the performances were terrific. So don't make an excuse that this was a boring film cos this is what Australian cinema is about</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[6]]<br/>A good flick,was this based on the Walsh St killings.<br/>I think Oz film making would be improved if they copied European style grittiness, get to the core,and devoid of schmaltz.<br/>Pope was good. Mum was too good,music was just bunged in probably as an afterthought.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[10]]<br/>this film did what i really think it set out to do- mainly, scare and disturb the hell out of the audience (i was shaking as i walked out of the cinema)- it was all done so well i thought-the cast were great but everyone's already said that- i didnt find the music overbearing at all like some people, the australian scenery was great and used to the maximum advantage, and there were even some bits you could laugh at, even if only because of the sincere and affective absurdity of some of the scenes which was really believable</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[8]]<br/>This really was a very good Australian film - tense, sinister, engrossing.  David and Margaret really got this one right.  There is acting brilliance by Jacki Weaver and Ben Mendelsohn in particular, and Guy Pearce and Joel Edgerton.   Far better than the over-rated Samson and Delilah, or Blessed.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[7]]<br/>Amelie wrote somewhere below: "This was a slow-moving, melodramatic, tiresome and utterly depressing film that strived to be meaningful but all that is really left is surface - a dark soundtrack, staring into space, characters "thinking" and pared back dialogue."  Not far from the truth. Judging from the audience reaction to some of the dialogue, a definite area for improvement. Do Aussies really communicate that badly? I did not find Ben Mendo physically scary enough though, but nonetheless an interesting screen character.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[9]]<br/>The most exquisite acting by an Aussie cast I have seen. Guy Pearce is exceptional, I didn't realise he was that good. And Ben Mendelsohn (welcome back, we missed you!) and Jacki Weaver - the whole cast, wow,  couldn't have done a single scene better. Students of film should study this to learn how to let the characters tell the story, not the Hollywood style of wanky props and special effects.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[9]]<br/>First Class - this was a very real and scary creation of the kind of negative space these egocentrics live in and create around themselves. <br/><br/>Perhaps that is why some people did not enjoy it. Psychopaths play out the battle in their heads in the real world and people get hurt. Beyond that there is no purpose to their lives or actions. There is no grand plan. No intelligence Just day to day survival within the negativity they 've created. <br/>It's terrifying.<br/>This movie holds this emotional space perfectly. Great acting! <br/></p>

The acting is so, well,  not acting.  I thought it was great storytelling instantly drawn into the these characters.   Mendelsohn, Pearce and Weaver as well as young J, amazing performances.   All great really.   How sad.  But so relatable .. there is a lot of dysfunction out there!   Am always impressed when one of our 'beautiful' actresses plays such an interesting and not so beautiful character.   Well done Jackie!!</p>

It is crazy to even suggest it is one of the best aussie films. It is an insult to call it as such when aussie cinema has produced such gems as Samson &amp; Delilah, Blessed, My year without sex, BEautiful Kate and Candy. The acting was good mostly, i give you that, but otherwise, a boring dud.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[9]]<br/>So happy to know this film is being seen because it more than deserves to be.<br/>Like last year's 'The Combination' this is a 'gradual' film. It keeps the viewer very tightly knit focusing on the key characters. I love the way this film brings you into the world of crime we witness unfolding. There are genuinly gripping, suspensful moments and a revelation of several stellar performances. James Frencheville is very solid and Jackie Weaver is just terrific. I loved the mood and atmosphere, the drama and the script. Animal Kingdom is a brilliant movie, another quality Australian drama.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[8]]<br/>A really well crafted film. A tastefully restrained presentation of a powerful story. The less is more approach to the detail of the drama adds to the tension and leaves you with more to ponder when you get home. Using the boy as the main focus provides a far more interesting and realistic perspective than the standard police vs villains fare. Great performances from all leads overcomes the usual problem of recognizing Australian actors in yet another role. In this film you see the characters not the actors.The soundtrack is great.</p>

Although I had no love for this - I was hooked! And interestingly, this story stayed with me after leaving the cinema. Grim, dark, thought-provoking and most of all - a movie that makes the audience do some work - Bravo! <br/><br/>Weaver is astonishing!

A major disappointment as I applaud good Australian films that move me (such as 'Blessed' and the sublime 'Samson and Delilah') but this left me cold.

We tend to dismiss children/young adults as too inexperienced to be able to think for themselves.

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[5]]<br/>I consider myself a great supporter of Aussie cinema.  I even like the dark dramas that everyone loves to hate.  I was excited by the reviews for Animal Kingdom but ultimately disappointed and frustrated by the film.  Can't believe David and Margaret gave this four and a half stars.  They can't be serious.  The film has some great actors but they are let down by a patchy script and poor characterisations.  There is no tension and the third act has many plot holes.  Really disappointing after everyone had labelled this as the best local film in years.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[10]]<br/>Brilliant storytelling, tense, and intelligently directed. Ben Mendelsohn is amazing, really frightening, twisted character delivered with the right amount of creepiness and violence. <br/><br/>Jacki Weaver also shines and delivers a unique complexity to her character. <br/><br/>Finally, Australian cinema to be proud of!</p>

I was so inspired watching it, the people paying it out for being depressing need to start living in the 21st Century, the word film does not mean happy viewing last time i checked. Characters like J really do exist i give David Michod props for being brave enough to include him no matter how frustrating he is ! The dialogue was so genuine. Loved it!</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[8]]<br/>Finally a real Australian story .This is a powerful film. Its power gets under your skin and manifests itself not unlike the grand matriarch of the film! The story line is a familiar one BUT its told so well. The acting is short of brilliant, by all.  Who ever knew Ben Mendelsohn could be so very, very disturbing. I had to take a star away because I just didnt know which decade I was in. Pearce's moustache? 2010 Range Rovers? 2000 commodores? Wooden Panneling? Granite benchtops? Pandora charm bracelets? Details are important!</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[7]]<br/>This was better than I expected but could have been much better. In the end the characters did not engage and were not totally believable. Script and direction a little wanting. Josh was so wooden for much of the film it was hard to believe it when he did react. Slow, I don't mind, the restrained depiction of violence is commendable and worked well, music good though could have been softer.</p>

Animal Kingdom is in all aspects a world-class film. Great cinematography, brilliant character development, good plot, well acted. I could not have asked for more. I'm hoping people take the opportunity to see it!</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[10]]<br/>This is the best Australian film made for quite some time. From the moment  the camera focused in on the cheesy lion relief on the wall I knew it would be a clever film. The soundtrack plays a big part setting the scene and the times which the film is set. <br/>Pope is terrifying &amp; I wanted to strangle the Grandma with my own bare hands by the end. I didn't buy her story about why she hadn't seen her only daughter for so long. There is only enough room for one woman in the family.<br/>Brilliant cinema.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[5]]<br/>Yes some good moments - but far apart - overall this movie failed to engage on any level except for an overall fear that something awful will happen. Give us the complexity of character, the diversity of situation, the absolutely unexpected that makes life the wonder it is. In this movie we have one-dimensional characters - the bad, the wicked, the afraid, the manipulative, the innocent. Why did J love his girlfriend - we had no clue - I could only deduce it was because she had big brown eyes - and I could go on....</p>

If you are after a tense, gripping, psychological crime thriller then look no further. <br/>The acting is superb with Mendelsohn the stand out with an honourable mention to Weaver.<br/>Some of the characters are very obviously based on real people in the Melbourne underworld and if like me you thought the Aussie film "The Boys" was brilliant then you are going to love this too.</p>

I loved the tension running through the whole movie, very still, but menacing. I thought Ben Medelsson's character Pope was disturbing and unpredictable. <br/>I also loved the everyday about it, the bad decor, the suburban house, Mum making the salad, TV on, the realisation that these families live amoung us, in our neighbourhood.<br/>I havent seen a movie this good for a long long time!<br/>Loved it!!  <br/></p>

Having said that it is so disappointing to read so many reviews that fail to appreciate this movie for every unique quality it has but fall into the old predictable patterns of criticising aussie films. We have a great industry here lets appreciate it.  Am I they only one to see the Jonathan Brown ( Brisbane player) likeness to the young grandson ???</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[2]]<br/>What's worse than a bad Australian film? A bad well-reviewed Australian film. <br/><br/>I can't believe Animal Kingdom has gotten such raves - it's a slow, empty film pretending it's so much more meaningful and clever than it really is. <br/><br/>There are major plot holes, the main character can't spare more than ONE expression throughout the whole film, and the so-called "tragedy" is never really felt because the characters don't really add up to much. Sure, Pope is slightly unhinged, but everyone else is fairly one-dimensional &amp; predictable. <br/><br/>The one thing I liked about this film was Guy Pearce's moustache.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[9]]<br/>Definitely the best Australian film that I have seen in a long time.   The disfunctional uncommunicativeness of these guys is spot on as is the sheer banality of their lives, no Underbelly glamour here.   Having been seeing Jacki Weaver perform for close to fifty years, this was a revelation.   Mendelson's psychotic is spot on.<br/>A must see.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[9]]<br/>As a former Probation and Parole Officer and prison Psychologist this movie was chilling.  Forget about the strict facts of the Walsh Street murders these characters are real and were stunningly portrayed in this movie.  There is nothing else to say but this movie was so raw, so close to the bone and so real.  The characters Pope and Janine were absolutely believable - so blinded and misguided; Ben Mendelson and Jacquie Weaver were masterful.  Truly a very, very worthwhile journey into other people's reality.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[3]]<br/>Smike is right, it's Walsh St lite. The power of this dreary docudrama comes from Jacki Weaver's performance. The Machiavellian schemer she plays is an amalgam of brothel-owner Kath Pettingill (mother of two of the Walsh St killers) and Melbourne's most famous crime matriarch, Judy Moran. But Jacki in this film is as sweet and innocent as she was in They're Playing Our Song and every other role she's had. You sit through Animal Kingdom wondering what drives this character, then you realise she doesn't exist in the real world. This should have been an Australian Fargo.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[4]]<br/>Sorely disappointed by "Animal Kingdom" after reading all of the rave reviews.<br/><br/>I was expecting a film that gripped me by the collar, but it just felt recycled and bland. I could see particular scenes coming, thanks to seeing them already occur in "No Country For Old Men" and "The Departed".<br/><br/>I found the character of J to have almost no charisma, standing around like a mopey Jason Segel look-a-like.<br/><br/>Only redeeming factors were Ben Mendelsohn, Joel Edgerton and Guy Pearce, who played their parts to justice, but were still let down by the unfortunately insipid script.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[10]]<br/>I loved this movie - a Masterwork indeed!  <br/>The acting, script, directing and music were faultless and each one an Oscar winning contribution.  In this movie we did not suffer endless shootouts, screeching car chases or  violent physical clashes.  Disposals were quick - shoot, bang, move on.  The undercurrent of tension was there throughout.  We didn't have to see the trial of Pope and his brother - we got the gist of the way it was to proceed.  This understating allowed the viewer to contribute to the story by using their own imagination.  <br/><br/>Congratulations on a brilliant movie.<br/><br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[8]]<br/>A very classy, gritty and well-paced film showcasing  some great Australian actors.  Ben  Mendelsohn &amp; Jacki Weaver's performances are simply outstanding.  I can't believe people didn't find this film tense and compelling.  I'm not into gratuitously violent crime or gangster films so was impressed with the understated way the director handled this confronting story.  This film is what Underbelly would like to be when it grows up!</p>

Irrespective of where it was made.<br/>The performances are without exception subtle yet chilling and complex. The young actor playing Jay is measured and evolves on screen.  He's brilliant. Menolsohn is a lunatic, terrifying.<br/>The script is great, direction wonderful. The cinematography is fantastic with what should be tired techniques such as the slow motion work is dramatic and the pace is wonderful.<br/>It was just great cinema.

It spoils an otherwise brilliant film.Forgive my ignorance but I have a few questions- why was Joel E's character shot by the fuzz? Can cops just kill like that? Also we jump from chatting about the court plan at the art gallery to what???? Too much left to the viewer to work out methinks.<br/>Music, especially opening credits-amazing. Cast and acting superb.

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[2]]<br/>Animal Kingdom is Walsh Street 'lite', a failure as a re-telling of history; a failure as a stand-alone story. Missing is all the rage, passion, horror, and violence actually involved in such a pointless execution.  <br/><br/>We do't see or hear the impact on the street; the outrage of the police and the community at large;  the terror in the criminal world.<br/><br/>The words 'murders' or 'police killings' are never used, weirdly disrespecting the pointless deaths of the young constables. We are never told that J is an accomplice, that he will be charged with murder if he does not talk.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[6]]<br/>It was easy enough to watch but what did we have really.  I jittery neurotic (good comic value) ,  a faceless young brother , "J" bit of a bore really,  the mother was creepy but to nutty to really figure for me (did she really care if anyone lived or died?) , a sociopathic killer mmm... and a loosley conveyed narrative which was bloody confusing and didn't seem to make sense.  It had no glue, maybe if I knew more about the "true story" it would have been better.  Great music and other aspects but something missing.   Ben was excellent</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[8]]<br/>I am a bit surprised people didnt find this film tense. When J runs to his girlfriends place and Ben M is after him I was sitting on the edge of my seat. Surely it was obvious to everyone what this guy was capable of? There were lots of moments like this. <br/>Anyway to me a good movie stays in your brain long after the credit roll- and this one most certainly did that for me.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[6]]<br/>continued...<br/><br/>It wings in on being endearing through quirkiness, a feeling of impending doom with the soundtrack etc (but what was and where was the doom?  There was insufficient power in the narrative to support the art), personable performances and humour.  Entertaining but overall fail in my book as a film with any real depth or greatness as being described by some.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[6]]<br/>I agree with those who say there was no tension  in this film,  except in a self generating affected way for the sake of it.  Where was the feeling of "kingdom" - just felt like a bunch of petty crooks, nobodys, why were the cops so resourced up to deal with them even?  Whether or not those two losers ended up nabbed and in the clink?  So?  I care because...?  <br/></p>

Reading the  comments here I think very few of the posters realise the movie is very much based on true events, seems very few people that live in Melbourne do not not actually know Melbourne's crime history. (here's a hint, it goes back way further than Underbelly part 1)<br/> Read up on the Pettingall clan and the Walsh St murders to be further educated and appreciate this movie more. <br/>A dark brooding movie.  I didn't think Jackie weaver could be this good.  Excellent</p>

But hey, everybody raved about "Let The Right One In" and I thought that was an average picture as well. So maybe its just me. This movie just didn't grip me as much as I wanted it too. It didn't move me. Ben Mendelson was terrific though.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[8]]<br/>I'm a bit astounded that nobody mentions the obvious parallels to the iconic ABC drama Janus of the early nineties. This film's Smurf and Pope are clearly the Shirl and Mal of that series. And I don't mean this as any sort of criticism. As the movie went on, more and more of the TV program started flooding back - and it made me feel really uneasy about what to expect. Both roles are underplayed here by comparison, and it works; Ben M doesn't seem at all miscast to me. Striking soundtrack, claustrophobic camerawork, a very troubling story that lingers.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[9]]<br/>Clever and thoughtful screenplay that doesn't relay on fillers by stating the obvious. The restraint created more impact, including the silence. Great music - its use reminded me of the brilliant Fargo score. The ending leaves you wondering about a whole range of scenarios that this family will now take, and who will be the king of jungle. Congrats to all involved. Great acting. Very enjoyable.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[1]]<br/>I cannot believe that critics are praising this film as a masterpiece of Australian cinema. This was a slow-moving, melodramatic, tiresome and utterly depressing film that strived to be meaningful but all that is really left is surface - a dark soundtrack, staring into space, characters "thinking" and pared back dialogue. I would have preferred to see Sex and the City 2 because at least it doesn't pretend to be something it is not.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[9]]<br/>A brilliant Australian film punctuated by some measured and chilling character performances, ably led by Mendelsohn, Pearce, Edgerton, and Weaver. I actually thought that Luke Ford's 'Darryn' was a spot-on and well-crafted performance - you really wanted to scream out and get him to intervene in the strangling scene. <br/><br/>We really shouldn't be understating the occasion of such a high-calibre cast of Australian actors doing their thing. This film will go from strength to strength as it travels overseas.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[5]]<br/>Great cinematography, great music and good performances yes (with the exception of the lead who is rather wooden)<br/><br/>The major problem with this film is its pacing. There's no suspense, no tension and while an atmosphere is present the film seems drawn out for rather shallow melodramatic effect.<br/><br/>No good film is too long and well this one is a bit too long.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[6]]<br/>Those who think this is the best Australian movie in years obviously hasn't seen "Blessed" or "Samson &amp; Delia". <br/><br/>Spoiler alert.<br/><br/>Am I missing something? Mum dies and her son, mother &amp; brothers couldn't care less. Two other sons die and Mum shows no emotion. Son's girlfriend dies but son agrees to give evidence that will free the uncle who murdered her. Son is in police protection but somehow meets with Granny and defence council without the police knowing, and agrees to give evidence that will free uncle. Then shoots uncle. Give me a break!<br/>Great performances but dopey stoey.</p>

I got my money's worth<br/>and appreciated the strong cast.  Loved Joel Edgerton, Jackie Weaver, and they were all strong. The inappropriate relationship between the mother and the sons was disturbing as it should be. The music was terrific. Go see it.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[6]]<br/>I am in general agreement with Mark and Jozee.  D and M have inflated its worth and the film is little different from a longish episode of Underbelly or other realistic insights into psychopathic crims and the police.<br/><br/>But the acting performances are good and so is the script. Jackie Weaver is particularly convincing. I do not now need to be persuaded about the moral equivalence of the police and crims but now David Michod wants us to believe the legal profession is in on it too...</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[9]]<br/>Its nothing like underbelly. How on earth can you compare such a terrible televsion show with cast of  ,Lets say 'Home and Away' status to Ben Mendelsohn, Joel Edgerton, Guy Pearce, Luke Ford, Jacki Weaver. The sound track and Direction of this film out weights anything I have seen in on televsion. It's focus is on the family rather than the life style of a crime family. Keep making good aussie films.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[8]]<br/>Jackie W is the new MIchael Caine and the boys all did a great job.  J's deadpan was teetering on the edge of wooden or just dumb - could have had a flicker more undercurrent there - A wonderful movie but a tad underwritten, no doubt as a reaction against fulsome Oz scripts. A few cliches like the slo-mo in the walking/carrying dead body scenes (shades of Underbelly) and ultra fast cutting which didn't allow some scenes necessary time to breathe out - <br/>But the framework was magic, the gradual unfolding of doom.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[9]]<br/>Loved the examination of mother-son relationships - here the mother is clearly replacing an absent partner with her 'boys'. Also thought James Frecheville was very well cast and thought the close up camera work on his teen skin showed the audience how young and vlunerable he was as a character. Also the scene where he was taught how to wash his hands showed just how bereft of an education he was without stressing the point too hard. Very well done.</p>

Why was there no exploration of J and his girlfriend's relationship? Why were J's girlfriend's parents so docile towards J when they were aware of his family and their history? Why was the J character so dead pan, flat and BORING? Why was the Cody character so glib, what was his background? Why would the cops kill a crook sitting in his car in the carpark in front of dozens of witnesses? What characters could we empathize with? NONE<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[8]]<br/>I hated this film!!!....but I was transfixed by it.  I loved the film actually...what I hated was the world it represented and the fact that that world exists in my city. I was so angry that that young person had to live that life, with virtually no option for escape. <br/>A very well made film....for reasons that others are best to explain. But I do know that it is full of amazing performances. Don't we love our magnificent Jackie Weaver, Ben Mendelsohn, Guy Pierce, Sullivan Stapelton &amp; Joel Edgerton....and now James Frecheville. Well done!!</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[6]]<br/>I went into this film with very high expectations after all the rave reviews I had heard. I was disappointed as I found it be like a weaker &amp; longer episode of Underbelly. While I found the performances solid, I found it a bit heavy &amp; depressing &amp; was glad it was over!</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[9]]<br/>Well, ignore what Harry Georgatos had to say and go and see this film.  It is really really good, and you'll be wondering why all Australian films aren't as good as this one.  Atmospheric, tense, creepy - what's not to like?  Great performance from Mendelsohn, Frecheville, Pearce, Weaver and Edgerton.  Really, I hope this does great business - everyone should see this film.</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[2]]<br/>Being stuck for 2 hours with these dead-beat surburban criminals was a depressive experience. This is a film for critics. If the industry thinks it's going to jump-start the local industry with this film then all the wrong people have the right job. These films are funded by the taxpayer and the taxpayer doesn't even want to watch them. We need more experienced commercial genre directors. NOW!</p>

<p class="comment">((Animal Kingdom))[[7]]<br/>This is a good  Crime Thriller Australian Film. Performances by Jackie Weaver, Ben Mendehlson are very good, while Guy Pearce is solid as usual as the policeman.<br/>The film is perhaps a bit long but certainly holds you until the nailbiting conclusion.<br/>The film does have similaries to  The Walsh St Murders in Melbourne in the 1980's.<br/>This along with last years The Combination are two of the better recent  Australian films I have seen.<br/></p>
