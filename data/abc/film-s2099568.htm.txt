<h3>No Country For Old Men</h3>
<p class="ratd"> Rated <em>MA</em></p>
<p><em>Review by David Stratton</em></p>
<p>JOSH BROLIN plays Llewellyn Moss, a Texas Everyman who, out hunting one night, stumbles across a massacre. Rival drug gangs have killed one another, leaving behind a suitcase full of money, which Moss takes with him. <br/><br/>But heís been spotted, and renegade killer Anton Chigurh (JAVIER BARDEN) goes after him. The third key character in the drama is Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, (TOMMY LEE JONES), who is hunting both the thief and the killer.<br/><br/>This magnificent film represents the best work the Coen Brothers have done since FARGO. Like that movie classic this is a cold-blooded thriller with a darkly humorous edge. <br/><br/>Stunningly photographed by Roger Deakins, who also shot THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES, itís a film filled with suspense which manages to be very cinematic even as it remains true to the book in most details. <br/><br/>The strong supporting cast includes KELLY MACDONALD and TESS HARPER as the wives of Moss and Bell respectively. Theyíre both splendid.</p>
<h3>Further comments</h3>
<p>DAVID: Margaret?<br/><br/>MARGARET: Everything about this film is absolutely wonderful. I mean, it is the most tense thriller...<br/><br/>DAVID: Yeah. <br/><br/>MARGARET: ...Iíve seen in a long time but, you know, that subtext, as represented by the Tommy Lee Jones character, Bell, the Sheriff Bell, just adds that depth to this film that puts it beyond the normal. You know itís really out there. And thank God that the Coen brothers, who have shown so much talent over their career and have had a couple of lacklustre efforts lately...<br/><br/>DAVID: Well, they have indeed. THE LADY KILLERS was unwatchable for me.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Really, theyíre so back in stride itís just...<br/><br/>DAVID: Yeah.<br/><br/>MARGARET: ...lovely to see and, you know, theyíve based it on this wonderful book by Cormac McCarthy, whose really one of Americaís most impressive writers these days. And I just loved it. Itís resonates within me. Itís got such a sense of place and language. <br/><br/>DAVID: Mm. Absolutely.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Oh, God, and Tommy Lee Jones is also the best heís been in ages, as well.<br/><br/>DAVID: Yeah. Absolutely classical scenes of suspense, too. <br/><br/>MARGARET: Yeah.<br/><br/>DAVID: I mean, you couldnít master...<br/><br/>MARGARET: No. I know.<br/><br/>DAVID: Hitchcock wouldnít have done the suspense better.<br/><br/>MARGARET: The motel.

No one else on the earth can keep you focused on the screen like these guys when they're in full flight. Blood Simple  plus 360 degrees. </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Kristine<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars0.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: I've watch test cricket that was faster than this drivel<br/>Wonderful scenery, Right, but, after a while looks like any other semi- arid- out- the- back- of- beyond<br/>Was the mumbling by most of the actors supposed to add to the ambience? If so, all it did was make me want to slap them.<br/>Tommy Lee Jones. Didn't he play that part in "Three Funeral"?<br/>Humour? Where?<br/> </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Ron<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars6.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: I enjoyed the first three quarters of the film, but the last quarter lost me. What was the point of Tommy Lee-Jones conversation with the man with the cats, his conversation at the end about his dreams of his father? In fact, I thought his character was superfluous to the movie. Also, what was the point of the car crash at the end? I prefer films to have an ending that makes sense to the viewer and brings the story to a satisfactory conclusion.  </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Pete<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Just saw it and it's a marvel.

I love the Cohen brothers like anyone else but this is hardly their greatest film.  Some nice cinematography (though not as good as Assassination of JJ) sure, but that hardly makes up for lack of story, mumbling characters and a very unsatisfying ending. Why this is in Oscar contention, I'll never know. What are the critics seeing that I'm missing?! </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Socceroo<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Kristine NO STARS!! really? For me this was even better than Fargo and that is saying something. Not too slow at all. Thoughtful, realistic and yes unconventional. Tommy-Lee Jones was brilliant and did indeed bring a wry humour to the role. If you don't get it then maybe Daddy Day Care is more your thing. </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: wendy<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars4.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: There are rivetting moments in this movie but a great deal of it doesn't make sense and it is one of the most sickeningly violent movies I have ever seen. The average woman will HATE this movie. </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: mogbrown<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars8.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Good acting, casting, cinematography - but not up to the standard set by Fargo </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Tim Wild<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars2.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Violence,oh my god,another stupid movie about a psychopath,who needs it ,not me. </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Rachel<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars6.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: The Coen Brothers do Quentin Tarantino. I think they have run out of good ideas and have been hanging out with QT at the pub. Not a new story - someone finds gang money and the violence begins. A beautifully shot film with a story I did not enjoy. What did the Sheriff add to the story he never actually did any detective work! </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Derek K.<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars8.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Amazing, but not a 5 Star movie. One of the best of the year, but no way #14 of all time (IMDB). </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Osar ...(really that is my name)<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Yes I agree with the rating given by Marg and Dave. I was very surprised at this movie. Its teh first time Ive wondered into a movie with someone else who didnt know what to expect, I thought i would probably be crap, but no, it was v good. In fact I regard this fim significantly better tahn Silence of the Lambs.  There is also a lot more scop, thogh this may sound bs to those who havnt seen it, for a sequel,. I hope there is a sequel to this move next year and it gets nomianted foranOscar. . </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Claudio Gomes<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars9.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Got there expecting another psycho-thriller and the usual screenplay cliches, aided by good performances and a nice photography. <br/>Well... the movie offers much more than that. <br/>Just like in FARGO the slow pace is used to add suspense, and humor is used to give you the necessary space to breathe. However, the plot here is much deeper and will bring quite a few surprises, until the very end, which, IMHO is quite unconvetional.<br/>The real challenge here is not really to follow the plot, but to understand the bloody Texan accent. </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Josh<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Brilliant. Bardem's villain chilled me to the core. I can't get it out of my head - a good thing. </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Laurie Newman<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Maybe I'm a bit slow, but the ending was a surprise. But then I got it, "No Country for Old Men". Right on. One thing, bloodstains on railing and path should have led anyone to find the valise of cash, but there was none. No wonder Woody was puzzled for a bit. Better than 'Fargo'. </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: greg holmes<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars7.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: People who say this is brilliant are a puzzle, I love the Coens but this is one too many from them, it becomes boring and though it has intense tension in parts, no doubt aobut that, and is meticulous in some ways and has some really beautiful shots it totally failed for me in the end. and I wanted it to end.  I don't know what was chalenging about it either, it gave me nothing new.  </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: SJW<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars6.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: I agree with Rachel wholeheartedly. The whole movie felt very Quentin Tarantino...the only thing missing was Uma Thurman. I hated the ending of this film. It felt like they got 3/4 of the way through and then just couldn't be bothered.  </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Shantel<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: A few women left the cinema I was in, in disgust. For me I just couldn't take my eyes away from the screen. Bloody marvellous </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Alan<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars1.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: How could I ignore Margaret's and David's 5 star recommendation to see this?  My first reaction was to wonder if Margaret and David had watched it all the way through.  There were a couple of good moments of suspense in this 121 minute film, granted.  But that left 120mins 50 seconds of half developed characters and  plot lines that went nowhere.   This didn't entertain, educate, or have any emotional impact at all, and judging by the stunned silence in the cinema when the credits rolled, I wasn't the only one to feed duped. </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Luke<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars0.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: If you like confusing plotlines, mumbling dialogue and no resolution to the story, you will love this. It's like taking a flight to visit New York City and when you get there you don't leave the airport lobby.<br/><br/>I admire the Coen Brothers for taking a risk with this film and I'm sad that I didn't enjoy it. </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Vincent Vaunguard<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars9.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: A disturbing but fascinating depiction of the brutality of American gun culture and the determination and resilience of the underdog in a land divided by economic apartheid, greed and criminality. A great story of redemption and desperation with the tones of a classic dark western. The Cohen brothers  have developed charcaters that expose the contradictions and harsh realities of the 'American dream' whilst sustaining a suspenseful plot line that chilled me to the bone with  Bardem's brilliant perfomance. Beautifully shot and excellently directed, it is great to see the Cohen brothers back at their best.  </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Kel<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars1.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Haven't we had enough of the pornography of violence. Lovely scenery but all that cold blooded killing! Get over it guys. </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: bob<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: top notch  </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Andrew<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: As a piece of film making this is surely among the Coen Brothers best work, the acting is out of this world (Tommy Lee Jones is stunning) but the ending is what makes this film for me. And it all comes down to one scene, really-  after Llewellyn's murder- where Sheriff Bell returns to the motel room and sees what is before him- but instead he walks away- unable to come to terms with the evil of the world, as embodied in Chigurh's character. Unquestionably one of the best films of the year. </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Helga<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars0.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: I went to see this film yesterday on the recommendation of David and Margaret. I was most disappointed - a terribly violent film. I came out of the cinema wondering why I had let myself sit through such rubbish.  </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Steve V<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: How much does chance, and how much does will determine events?  What if the Sheriff had arrived a few minutes earlier? What if the coin had flipped the other way? How often do we allow chance to justify our actions? How often do we refuse to allow chance to be the justification? What if the suppression of evil requires chance to be with you? The inevitable is more likely not occur by the intervention of the unlikely than by some plan to prevent it. These are some of the questions that give this brilliant film sense.  </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Brook<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars1.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Er suspense thriller alright.  The most frustrating thing for me was the strong accent they put on and I couldn't understand half of the shite they were talking about.  It's like watching a foreign movie - better with subtitles.<br/><br/>And no, I didn't enjoy or appreciate it as much as my other half or others did - I loathed it! </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Bruce<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars1.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Suspense, when camera lingers on the faces of someone about to die violently at the hands of the psychopath? A cheap  way to generate tension in a film.<br/>The one compelling aspect of the story is when Moss returns to the scene of the massacre with water for the man dying in the car: our reviewers miss this.<br/>M and D you need to find alternative work. You are so driven to debate tecnhical/historical aspects of films that you cannnot see the wood for the trees. Stand in front of a mirror and you will find that you have no clothes.<br/><br/> </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Carleen Devine<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars0.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: I'm shocked at David and Margaret's rating.  If we were seeing a true life news report of a massacre, we would be horrified and "tuttutting" about the degraded level to which our society had sunk.  Yet David and Margaret extol a serial cold-blooded killer as the best entertainment ever.  This is the last time I look at their program.  Their  values certainly aren't mine.  </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: samlor<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars6.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Not bad but not as good as reviews rave. So what if they are celebrity directors? Critics should do their job properly/stop fawning over the makers/branding and concentrate on the film/product. I did not find it all THAT thought provoking, ground-breaking or entertaining. </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: emli<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars7.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: <b><br/>[Edit: Comment deleted.

A few things I did'nt understand, but I think thats because i'm an aussie not a yank, for example; like how they value life in that part of the world.  Bardem's performance is insane and worth a mention. I really enjoyed how a lot of the scenes did'nt have much dialogue but the acting was telling the story. Not as good as Fargo but that's my opion. I say go see it if you enjoy watching quality well made films.  </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Sophie<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Saw this tonight [after reading the mixed reviews on here]...flipped a coin on it....I think it's a film you'll either love or hate - personally I LOVED it. The themes of life/death, fate/chance and the overall comparison of flawed humanity vs. total evil [no humanity] were portrayed in this intense, edge of your seat style thriller - I was on the edge of my seat more than once due to Javier Barden's perfect portrayal of his character, Anton. In fact I found all the acting to be top-knotch and the cinematography simply stunning. It's something different.   </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Peter v<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Five stars from me, too.<br/>The Coen Brothers right back on their top form;  their best since "Fargo" if not their best ever.<br/>The script is perfect and very tightly shot.  The performances are rivetting, right down to the smallest character bit parts.  Bardem goes into the gallery of great nightmare-inducing menace.<br/>I would not describe the film as "violent"; the body count is Shakespearian but , as the film progresses we are shown less of it, Bardem's presence is sufficient .<br/>  .  It is good to see one of this great writer's books finally done justice on the screen </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Terry<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars1.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Not so sure about a 5 star movie, the only thing good about it was that it had some excellent camera and editing work. The story was weak, it was overly violent. I have a great degree of respect for Tommy Lee Jones, but not for accepting the role in this movie, he never got out of the starting gate in this one, you can't tell me that delivering half a dozen drawled lines was acting. Sorry guys but give this one a big miss, far from a pleasent experience. The audience was unimpressed. </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: David Burton<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars5.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: After seeing the review on The Movie Show all I can say is David and Margaret must have 'lost the plot' to give it 5 stars each.<br/><br/>OK  there's the masterful performance by the killer Javier Barden, saves the movie in fact. <br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones needs subtitles.<br/><br/>The 'use a 50mm lens wide open' style of cinemaphotography  (that is -everything is in soft focus except the main point of interest) - is lazy.<br/><br/>Suspense is maintained  till past half way then, in a crucial point I thought I must have fallen asleep and missed something.<br/><br/>It's an interesting flick, flawed but interesting. </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Jason<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars8.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: The way the movie ends with two long dialogue scenes is a bit weird. Some where in that is the crux of the movie. I will have to see it again to make sense of it. Had a bit of a chuckle when the immediate end of the film was met by shocks of horror by the older ladies either side of me.

If you don't understand the ending, think a little bit, it makes perfect sense.

True, the film didn't really touch on any new themes - which may ultimately effect any serious oscar chances, but the story telling and film making on display here are exemplary.

But it does become lost about half way through the film. There are totaly un-realistic situations and deductions made by the film makers. And the plot gets lost  and confused.

I went along knowing nothing about the film, certainly  not expecting the amount of blood - totally unaware that the book was by Cormac McCarthy - had to hit my head when the credits came on - of course, it was his - so intense and unremittingly disturbing all the way through - but un-put-downable. Sure, the story can be read literally - but how much more disturbing if the Anton Chigurh character is, in fact, not a real person - but a metaphor for the complexity and un-stoppable, relentless horror of modern crime. </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Enomis<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars9.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Brilliant!

Not  the Coen brothers' best. Fantastic cinematography, great atmosphere and an unforgettable performance by Bardem are the highlights. But I thought Tommy Lee Jones' character was a bit pointless and the film fell away in the last quarter. The ending disappointed. Still, there is enough here to warrant four stars. I'm surprised Bardem's portrayal hasn't attracted more accolades, it is truly brilliant and worthy of an Oscar. It's wonderful to see more of this great Spanish actor.

That the Coens were able to make a suspenseful thriller without losing any of the books' sense of time, place and universal philosophical, political and social relevance is amazing. One of McCarthy's enduring themes is the importance of borders and transgressions in illuminating the reality underlying our lives - hence Texas/Mexico, mundane/criminal, and of course violence. In this film the Coen brothers exemplify this cinematically, through the blurring of the thriller genre with a reflective philosophical piece, using, subverting and transgressing audience expectations to make a compelling movie that resonates strongly. A masterpiece.  </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: David<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars1.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: David and Magaret,  I will never go to see a movie on the strength of your recommendation again.

But I struggled to decode this one, to fugure out what the directors were trying to say. Was it that evil flourishes when good men are too old for decisive action? Ie that scene towards the end where the sherrif almost finds Chuger but doesn't check the room next-door. Or that with the failure of good men to defeat evil, even God/Fate/Karma is powerless? Ie the failure of the car accident to stop Chuger. But I don't know. PS I wish audiences could deal with violence without tittering. </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Andrew Steadman<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Cormac McArthy's book reads like a Coen Brothers screenplay. With its multiple narrative perspectives it reminded me of many other of their films; BloodSimple, MillersCrossing, Fargo, which to me were all fantastic platforms for this master stroke. Many camera shots and movements encourage a doubling of characters to both other characters (ie. Moss &amp; Chigurh) to even creatures (ie. Chigurh &amp; a crow and also a deer that gets wounded by Moss)... <br/>       The kind of movie that students should be studying.

Now in retrospect this is a fiver. It's blood simple done with maturity and reflection, and with that depth and open endedness that warrants repeats viewings. It's the Coens' Vertigo.

Multi layered, powerful commentary on past, present &amp; future,represented by old school sherif, the struggling vet who once fought for his country which has now let him down, and the sociopath lacking any warmth/ humanity; passing on responsibility  to his innocent/incidental victims( coin tossing fate) -Directly involved victims don't get this choice. Jones' character book ends the movie perfectly.

I truly think that we are a country inhabited by a majority of people who are completely inept to the concept of cinema. However, I digress, The Coens have yet again crafted an amazing genre piece that shifts its focus on human nature and compulsive violent actions. The core theme is morality as opposed to free will. The coin of which Anton uses to decide the fate of others acts as a metaphor to the film's intentions.

A warning: "presents a vicious, depressing and dystopic view of life" would have been appreciated. Yes, great direction,  tension, camera and acting, BUT it's an ugly story.

The Coen Brothers are pure genius at setting suspense. so many scenes stood out for me: the scene when Chigurgh is drinking milk and the camera zooms in on him very slowly, is so reminiscent of Alex De Large, including his bizarre hairstyle. Chigurgh's murder weapon of choice is so strange and original, and he is so cold and unfamilliar that i know he will go down in time as a classic and original villain, one of the scariest, as the film is not a fantasy, slasher or sci-fi but very, very realistic.  </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: AD<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: This is a challenging film that will make you think about violence, acts of randomness and greed. Its pace matches the slow Texan drawl and yet there are many subtle clues in the film that I recognised only after thinking about the film once it had finished. The casting and acting were superb and the absence of a music score only enhanced the suspense. For me the most disturbing scene in the film was when Sheriff Ed Tom (sounds like Anton) drank the milk and watched his reflection in the TV.  The ending was just right.

Did the director die three quarters of the way through filming and a substitute stepped in to finish it off ?  I spent the first part scared witless by Javier Bardem's character and can only compare him to Hannibal Lecter for creepiness.  The 4 stars are for him really and the scenes in the hotel/motel rooms.  The sound of the lock being blown out of the door was scarier than any of the murders.

But this was a misguided choice of material for them.  Cormac McCarthy is perhaps America's most over-rated writer of the past few decades.

The violence is disturbing because it isn't just visited upon the "baddies" and is no worse than anything inflicted by Arnie, Bruce, James Bond &amp; co. The context, if anything, is more realistic. The multiple themes running through the film still have me thinking. The characters and casting were brilliant &amp; the cinematography beautiful and confronting.

What sets this movie aside is the depth of subtext that exists amongst each character and which paints an accurate and facsinating representative portrait of the life journey of men, their relationships, attitudes, expectations and struggles through life. Beyond this i also feel that the character of Anton is representative of a grim reaper style character - the inevitability and random selection of death. The silence is what speaks the loudest in this film. </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Stamos<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: By far the best film of the year, and one of the best ever.

I feel strangly unsatisfied.   </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Rudy<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars3.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Old plot regurgitated with newly spectacular violence but no depth of character.

I think they tried a bit too hard to be faithful to the book, when a lot of what happens at the end of the book just doesn't translate well to the screen.  <br/><br/>It did seem to get lost in the last half hour and I think a lot of that could have been left out, as it just didn't make a lot of sense on film, was trying to convey undercurrents that exist in the book but couldn't be explored properly on film.  </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Sherpro<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: The comments on this site are polarised 50% either way.

I agree that the ending was frustrating as it did not follow the conventions of a typical plot.

But with this movie, when it comes time for payback, the storyteller has skipped town leaving only a plot deficit behind. <br/><br/>This felt like three separate stores: (1) A lazy lawman telling senile stories, (2) An omniscient, super-psycho running rampage and (3) A wannabe trying to outsmart the mob. The three parts could have occurred in three separate times and places and left me wondering if the actors were averse to working with each other. </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Rachel<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars9.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Just saw it yesterday, fantastic movie. </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Jheme<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars7.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: A good movie, good script but it was way too slow.<br/>If it wasn't like watching grass grow, would probably have earned 4 1/2-5. </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Kieran Smith<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Absolutely fantastic in every department.

You will find that the people who hated this film thought it was stupid, slow, violent and didn't understand the ending. The reason they didn't understand the ending is because they haven't taken note of the title of the film. Many people get caught up with the story involving greed, stupidity and violence which refers to the current state of American society and forget that the movie is about Tommy Lee Jones' character.

Usually wait for the DVD but upon David &amp; Margaret's rating together with the fact it is a Coen Bros film it was a must see.

Violent but not about violence. <br/><br/>Looses half a star because Tommy Lee Jones is too well known - too identifiable as the actor, rather than the character.

A pathological killer trails a bumbling redneck so unbelievably stupid that it's hard for the audience to care what happens to him.<br/><br/>When the sheriff rambles on about his job, his father, his dreams, we wonder just what this contributes to the movie.

Never have I seen a more astute portrayal of a sociopath, their lack of empathy and desperate need for control. Like a child pulling the wings off a fly and seeing what it does....<br/><br/>Truly great films don't insult the intelligence of the viewer by forcing them down a linear and pedictable path. If you want perfectly enunciated and prosaic dialogue, a storyline that is easy to grasp,and two dimensional characters this film definately isn't  for you.

That last speech about his dream would have been one of many insightful scenes in a much better film, instead it's the only scene in this film that attempts to mean something instead of be stylish.

Atmosphere very good, until I found the Barden character too robotic and unstoppable ("just a flesh wound"). To maintain suspense the situations have to be recognisable so that we can imagine ourselves in them, but Chigurh reveals he isn't human but a personification of Evil, and "the rules" of the real world are suspended. The baddies are omniscient, omnipresent and omnipotent, while law enforcement is non-existent. I gave up caring. The pointless Woody Harrelson detour and the non-ending may be unconventional. Doesn't mean it's effective. </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: BJ<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars10.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: Mumbling dialogue?

Just a bracket in time, stories don't end in real life, this i feel is beautifully captured.<br/><br/>I loved this film, the internal struggle to remain honest to ones beliefs and philosophies endured by every charactor was so powerful.

The production and performances are magnificent. The violence is not graphic, by the standard of the youth films of today, and becomes less so as the film progresses. Chigurh is death , touching the good and the evil with equal impassivity; whether he visits you can be the toss of a coin. Greed is a powerful force threading through society, against which good men can feel isolated and impotent. We want compassionate law enforcement, but is it adequate in dealing with organised criminals? The film suggests not.  Indeed, multi-layered. </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Jimmie<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars7.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: It seemed interesting at the start of the film, however, the perpetual murder and gory became incessantly mundane by the end. I was annoyed by the fact that the film had no resolution at the end. A few scenes were superfluous, and the storyline wasnt all that great.

No Country for Old Men is full of gratuitous bloody violence for shock sake alone.

Talk about being overhyped. There is nothing to this movie. What is the point of it? Admitedly, the filming was beautiful, and some scenes were creepy (eg Anton and Moss in the hotels rooms), but I found the rest of it pointless The characters were weak, flat and one-dimensional, and the story was unconvincing and not really compelling.

How dare you talk down to us like your opinion is 'more sophisticated'! Personally, i'm VERY passionate about appreciating quality movies, and this film just didn't do anything for me...yet "The Assasination of Jesse James" (to me) was a VASTLY superior movie! The acting, cinematography and  script were outstanding! But "No Country" felt mediocre, had  a unsatisfying ending, mumbling actors, excessive violence and an uninspired story.

The problem is that people don't (or will not ) appreciate that there are perhaps more persuasive countervailing arguments against this film. You can point out good things you like about it, or you can say it was good for x. y and z. But some people forget to look at the bigger picture, or put the film in perspective and look to what it is lacking etc. Ok it was a chilling thriller. but so what? </div><div class="NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN"><em>Name</em>: Paul<br/> <em>Rating</em>: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229134020im_/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/audience/stars2.png"/><br/><em>Comment</em>: This movie had a lot of potential but it was sadly wasted.  We had to resort to putting subtitles on because we couldn't understand most of the dialogue.  Is mumbling cool these days?  A ridiculously disappointing ending - did they run out of budget?         </div>
