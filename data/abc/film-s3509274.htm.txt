<h2>Prometheus</h2>
<p class="ratd"> Rated <em>MA</em></p>
<p><em>Review by David Stratton</em></p>
<p>In 2089 on the Isle of Skye, scientists Elizabeth Shaw, NOOMI RAPACE, and Charlie Holloway, LOGAN MARSHALL-GREEN discover cave paintings identical to those already discovered in many different parts of the world - they depict a man reaching out to a strange constellation of stars. Three years later Shaw and Holloway are among the crew of Scientific Exploratory Vessel Prometheus, heading for the planet closest to the stars depicted in the drawings. <br/><br/>Also on board are Captain Janek, IDRIS ELBA, the powerful representative of Weyland Corp, Meredith Vickers, CHARLIZE THERON, and David, MICHAEL FASSBENDER, a suave, all-intelligent android who models himself after Peter O'Toole in LAWRENCE OF ARABIA. Prometheus lands on the planet, and in a vast cavern the scientists make some strange, unsettling, discoveries.<br/> <br/>There's been a huge amount of hype about Ridley Scott's long-awaited prequel to his 1979 classic, ALIEN, and the result isn't quite justified. On many levels, PROMETHEUS is a great sci-fi movie; it looks wonderful, the visual effects are amazing (some were done by Weta Workshop in NZ, others in Australia at Fuel VFX in the Sydney suburb of Newtown) and there are some unforgettable scenes, one involving Noomi Rapace and some abdominal surgery. But the screenplay, by Jon Spaihts and David Linderlof, falters, failing to develop some key characters and story strands, and, in the end, it's a touch frustrating. Still, a Ridley Scott sci-fi thriller is something to get excited about, and PROMETHEUS has enough tension and jolts to the system to make it well worth seeing. <br/><br/>The cast is a good one, with Guy Pearce, under tons of makeup, making the all-powerful Weyland an interesting character and Michael Fassbender very creepy as the all-knowing android with a strange sense of humour.</p>
<h2>Further comments</h2>
<p>DAVID: Margaret, what did you think?<br/><br/>MARGARET: Well, it ain't no ALIEN, that's for sure, because that was sort of like such a landmark film, and it was clean and simple and enormously suspenseful and the characters were well developed and really, in this they're not. I agree with you, I think the fault is very much in the screenplay. I think Idris Elba is fabulous as the captain but, there are so few standout performances and I actually think Noomi Rapace is actually quite disappointing in the central role. <br/><br/>DAVID: Well, maybe she doesn't have all that much to work with, do you think?<br/><br/>MARGARET: No, it's the screenplay.<br/><br/>DAVID: Yes.<br/><br/>MARGARET: It really is and even narratively it's sort of like muddled.<br/><br/>DAVID: Well, it's interesting because ALIEN itself, the original ALIEN, was really a slasher movie in space.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Yes.<br/><br/>DAVID: You've got the cast. One by one they're being killed off by this hardly seen assailant. HALLOWEEN by John Carpenter was made the same year or about the same time. Very similar ideas. This, of course, is quite different. This is a sort of voyage to find out the origins of humanity and...<br/><br/>MARGARET: Yes, grand themes but really it's the same thing, . <br/><br/>DAVID: Yes.<br/><br/>MARGARET: A group of people go to some planet where there's this horrible creature that's going to get them.<br/><br/>DAVID: Yes.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Der! I was very disappointed. I think it even got to the point of being quite silly, even that abdominal surgery thing is...<br/><br/>DAVID: Oh, I thought that was rather marvellous actually.<br/><br/>MARGARET: Oh, come on. No, Ridley, please, get back on the horse. Three stars from me.<br/><br/>DAVID: I'm giving it three and a half.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[10]]<br>One of the greatest science fiction films of all time that deals with the most important themes such as our origins, how did we get here, who created us, the search for eternal life, archaeological messages, the danger of making contact with an unknown species, a future threat to our existence, the use of aliens as weapons of mass destruction, human emotions v computer logic...and the list goes on.<br><br>I'm actually dumbfounded by the poor reviews this has received and suspect many just don't get it. Absolutely cant wait for the sequel.</br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[0]]<br>The script was bad. The acting was bad. The plot was awful. <br><br>But by far the worst part of Prometheus is what it's done to the Alien franchise. Aliens have gone from being mysterious badass xenomprphs from some distant part of the galaxy to being a by product of weird black goo created by other 'aliens' who look exactly like humans.. Who also created humans! Wait.. What?? Why?? So nonsensical and just plain unnecessary. Can we just pretend Prometheus never happened? And someone please slap lindelof. Hard.</br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[4]]<br>David Lynch says you watch a movie to forget who you are and to totally immerse youself in another world. Lynch creates a genuine alternative reality which is scary and real. He does this with excellent scripts and gently teases out some great acting from his troupe. His films nevertheless make no sense. This film tries to make sense but is really nonsense. There is nowhere to go with this plot. As David said, it is really Halloween in deep space. it is not some intellectual circus.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[8]]<br>Loved it! As a new fan being introduced to the franchise, I thought it was brilliant!<br>More than just your average sci-fi horror film... I grew to like the lead characters and the 'origins of life' plot was a great way to hook in the audience.<br>And the special effects - GAWD ALMIGHTY HUZZAH!<br>Setting - a cave=check. Mildly evil robot saboteur=check. Freaky gooey aliens=check. Lead character that would probably act the same way you would in that situation=check.<br>Prometheus: a sequel to 'Alien' does exactly what it says on the tin. Awesome.</br></br></br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[8]]<br>Prometheus tackles some major subject matter which is cleverly hidden in a distracting and often outrageous storyline.    <br><br>Spoiler Alert!!<br><br>The film does an excellent job of tying together the deceased pilot of the spaceship in the original with the Engineer of humankind ; very eerie when re-watching Alien!  Prometheus also explains the origin of the Alien, and so completes the circle.  Little did we know Ripley and her crew had shared DNA with the Alien they encountered in the original.  Hopefully the sequel will show the origins of the Engineer, or maybe there is a long chain of alien begatting alien....</br></br></br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[4]]<br>Besides the visual effects the story line went nowhere.a complete let down.someone has a terrific if not evil imagination to even conceive the birth of an octopus that kills the god like creature ,the Engineer,who in turn gives birth to another hideous creature. The whole movie has evil devil like intent.its a result of an evil disturbed mind.</br></p>

It is NOT that hard to come up with a plot to precede Alien so how could you fail so dismally with this. <br>Not even Charlize Theron or Edris Elba save this nonsense.<br>I want my money back.</br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[3]]<br>Yet another franchise that does not respect the mythology &amp; or facts of the brilliant original. Alien was a true ground breaker.... a combo of old world Horrror with Sci Fi that ultimately convinced (A HARD Task). Camerons action packed fest sequel was not the same, but was honest in it's intent and ultimately very satisfying. Since then nothing but lame, misconcieved and junk cash in's that betray the original.. anyone reminded of Highlander,Star Wars etc missteps here :)</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[2]]<br>could it be that the producers wanted a hip young movie to make back the invested bucks?<br><br>Question.....<br>What was the old guy doing in the movie? Besides acting badly as an old guy, yes he was supposed to be near death and maybe past his natural term of existance. But why not have an old guy play the part of an old guy?<br>The makeup on the old guy looked as if it was done by a very old guy about to die (a bit rushed on the wrinkles, perhaps it was the plastic look that made me laugh so much).</br></br></br></br></br></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[3]]<br>This film looks great, with some very spooky interiors and atmospheric lighting.  Some great special effects too.  All these combine to create an atmosphere of suspense, fear and impending disaster.  Apart from these factors, the rest of the film is rather disappointing.  It follows an entirely predictable course. Inquisitive humans land on alien planet, go exploring and find something nasty, which they then have to fight, trying to escape.  Some of the characters have hidden agendas, which compound the threats to the crew. Screenplay is messily confusing, script is leaden, acting is wooden, apart from the creepy David (Michael Fassbinder.)</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[9]]<br>Sure, there were some parts of the story that weren't fully explained, but that leaves the fun of trying to fill in the gaps. Plus, knowing today's society, there will most likely be a sequel; I can imagine this could very well explain things a bit.<br><br>Besides, the visual effects were very well done (one of the only movies that was worth seeing in 3D), the plot still worked well in itself, and the characters David and Janek were performed extremely well. Plus, the music was very... atmospheric.<br><br>Very well-rounded and put together. Definitely a favourite of mine.</br></br></br></br></br></p>

Too many stupid characters and incongruities - why would you send out a mission like this manned by such a gang of incompetent turkeys. The alien at the end looked about as scary as my daughter's rubber dinosaur and as for that octopus thing, what can I say.  The basic idea of seeking out an extraterrestrial human origin is a good one but very badly executed. Maybe James Cameron can make a good sequel.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[8]]<br>I understand David and Margaret. However, viewed on it's own merits it does offer some interesting ideas regarding the birth of the "alien" itself. Consider: in every alien film the incidence of the alien exhibits  borrows from the genetics of its host. Prometheus makes the proposition that the "alien" was born of a human alien hybridization occurring as an accident because our progenitors instituted a gene poison which mutates any host into a monstrous anomaly the ultimate goal of which is to exterminate a mistake: us. It's complicated and it's slippery and it needed better exposition. But i like it.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[8]]<br>Utterly spectacular looking movie.  Sure, the writing went off track for a little while and not everything ended up making sense, but the performances were mostly wonderful and Charlize Theron looked sensational.  I think those viewers that wanted more Aliens in it kind of missed the point - it's not about them, it's about how they came to be, and that's explained well.  A good effort and I can't wait for the sequel.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[6]]<br>I wonder if this film would have made more sense if I'd seen Alien?  Never mind, you can't erase memories to start afresh, and this definitely leaves a few, from the amazing special effects, spectacular scenes and odd creatures.  But the characters generally fail to develop or show the rationale for many of their somewhat odd actions.  Maybe this was made to reserve some insights for those who return for repeat viewings.  But I don't think I'll be one of them.  It's tough being critical of the actors, as many didn't get a lot to work with.</br></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[7]]<br/>While fans of the original series may be dissapointed with the story, and while we all were unhappy with the illogical behaviour of some of the characters, as a stand alone Sci-fi film I enjoyed it. Ridley Scott has again shown us that fancy effects should be used to compliment a film not dominate it, and to this end the special effects, coupled with great cinematography, lighting and music combine to created an  eerie yet intriguing atmosphere. Finally, applause must go to Michael Fassbender for his outstanding performance as the sophisticated, well mannered android 'David'.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[8]]<br/>I really enjoyed this film. The special effects and costumes were excellent, the plot was reasonable and the standard of acting was high. Aside from similarities of the predictable android character (reflective of the first Alien film) and the corny ending I was totally involved in this film. The film provides a platform for the inquisitive mind to question and explore the existence of humans and other life forms, and the reason for their existence and their extinction.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[0]]<br/>If you just had an alien cut from your stomach do you think you would be able run around like an olympic athelete minutes later? Having declared earlier that you want to get the hell out of the scary cave, would you then go up to an leech-like alien creature and say how cute it looks? And why exactly is the owner of the ship hiding away from the rest of the crew?<br/><br/>If you enjoy plot holes galore or just like throwing money down the drain, then buy a ticket to this movie. Otherwise give it a miss.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[6]]<br/>Re the epic-answer-to-the-meaning-of-life-the-universe-and-everything-voyage turned kill-fest. I do believe this was intentional and one reason is that essentially this is a sci-fi/horror film. But deeper than that, the disappointment of meeting your maker only to find he starts ripping his heads off without a single word is clearly too much of a contrast to be accidental. It says something about belief, perhaps that faith doesn't need a reason or to be grounded in reality and 'answers'. Secondly Ridley and fans always wanted an 'origin of the Alien' movie, and this is clearly setting up the sequel which will provide!</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[8]]<br/>It was meant to cause discord.  The problem is that everybody is using Alien as the measuring tool.  This is not Alien.  This is not 2001, either.  This is Prometheus, a stand alone movie and a very good one, actually.  So, let's forget about Alien.  Let's imagine we have never seen Alien.  A movie about ideas, difficult ideas, is meant to be good.  I was left with many questions.  Same happened with The Matrix, Inception, even 2001, Alien and Blade Runner.  A movie that does that and makes me see it again is a very good movie. Excellent</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[4]]<br/>Visuals were great! the 3D was done nicely without being in your face all the time.<br/><br/> Apart from the visuals.... <br/><br/> There was little atmosphere created among the characters, making you not really care if they bit the dust (which most of them did). Fassbender's android character alerts us to the theme "what makes humans human", carried over from Ridley's Blade Runner. This coupled with the broader philosophical question "where do we come from?" makes you wonder whether you've seen it all before.............<br/><br/>Some scenes didn't make sense, were unrealistic and contradictory to earlier developments. <br/><br/>Watchable, but only just..........</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[3]]<br/>It's a sad indictment on a film when its most charismatic character is an emotionless humanoid robot. Fassbender provides the only performance worth mentioning in what was an unmoving movie experience; the other actors - most of whom were miscast - unable to exploit anything interesting in their roles.<br/><br/>Prometheus is a beautiful looking, pseudo-existential, characterless, emotionless, badly acted, poorly cast (Fassbender the exception), cliche-ridden film, that should have undergone a dozen more rewrites before any camera was allowed to roll.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott revisiting his Alien roots - what could possibly go wrong? - Prometheus.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[4]]<br/>To me a prequel should tell the back story of the film it precedes. I went to this film to see the ship in 'Alien' arrive at its final destination, where it was found by the crew of the Nostromo. Prometheus gave us a tale of a different ship, with a different cargo, whose crew somehow suffered the same fate as the ship from 'Alien'. The aliens were just odd: some 'black oil' that causes eye worms and monstrous fast-growing offspring? Or that turned worms into killers, or men into marauding zombies? Violence and effects for their own sake. Disappointing.</p>

I dont understand how Margaret and David could possibly fault this screenplay without even touching on the terrible pace of SnowWhite and the Huntsman. Yes characters development was lacking, but it was where it needed to be. And in the case of David, in the absence it needed to be in. Anyone who even tries to compare this to alien is going to hate. They are both amazing... but completely different in every way. This stunning movie of action, and build up easily deserve four and a half stars. Even five just for Charlize-Theron's characters intrigue/mystery</p>

That last scene undermined the intelligence of Ridley's fans, an obvious EP decision.<br/>The one and only aspect I loved about the film was the unusual romantic link between Fassbenders character ' the android' and O'Toole's Lawrence of Arabia.

How does a trillion dollar mission have that crew?<br/><br/>* Unconvincing character reactions - I still don't know if this was supposed to be first contact or not! <br/><br/>* Ridiculous, inconsistent character decisions - They had no plan at all for what to do on the ground, did they? <br/><br/>The worst thing is, it coud have been wonderful!

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[5]]<br/>If you want to see anything resembling the Alien franchise creature for &gt;0.5 seconds, forget it. <br/><br/>Essentially this is a separate film about astronauts/scientists trying to find aliens who may have created humans in the first place. <br/><br/>Though none of the cast are annoying, everything falls flat because the screenplay really is blah. It's also very choppy and increasingly unrealistic - a self-surgery scene is followed by a character entering a room semi-clothed and near death whilst no one notices. <br/><br/>The whole film is like this: almost every character is self-absorbed, so who cares when death rocks up?</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[9]]<br/>This is a very good film. The cast perfect. We are not as interesting as we think we are, our day to day lives 'generally speaking' are pretty predictable.  <br/><br/>One day, we'll be able to self-diagnose and sit in a device to carry out 'corrective' tasks such as dental, orthopaedic or diagnostic surgery... what was 'Miss Vickers' device setting again? <br/><br/>Are humans the offspring of a greater being from outer space? Is our purpose to 'test' newly discovered habitable planets, earth, to ensure that it is suitable for occupation by a greater being? Which side is the 'Alien' really on?<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[8]]<br/>This is one of the best true sci fi movies I've seen in ages. Although it provides some back story for Alien, it is really a grand canvas for exploring ideas around creation and faith. I loved it all. The visuals, the acting and the story.  I think many of the negative reviewers don't appreciate the movie for what it is. It is in the genre of 2001 Space Odyssey. I suspect it suffers from the expectations that come with setting it in the 'Alien' franchise universe.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[10]]<br/>This is a really excellent film. Best film of 2012 for me so far, no doubt. The theme is so appealing, and the ideas and the context is really intriguing and gets you thinking. The actual atmosphere in the film is spell-binding stuff, and very suspenseful.<br/><br/>Yes, it is a bit predictable, yes the script is a bit stilted, but so what? Its definitely not worth deducting even half a star from this bonafide masterpiece.<br/><br/>Don't listen to Margaret, she's always wrong. Honestly, David is ok most of the time, but Margaret is always wrong. Don't miss this film.</p>

To all the those who keep stating the flaws in logic...<br/>(spoilers)<br/>1. it is obvious why David does what he does... <br/>2. Vickers doesnt run in straight line running as it seems on first viewing and she hasnt got time to turn around and see exact size and shape of ship about to land on top of her... only we have that ability<br/>3. the star markings DONT lead to THAT planet, just the system, THEY choose which planet/moon to explore.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[6]]<br/>If you were funding a 3 trillion dollar venture, why would you select an angry, nasty geologist who can't see rocks of interest, a captain whose remarks include "them guys", a scientist who says, "I'm with you, babe," scientists who remove helmets in an uncertain environment, and a security man who is immediately dissuaded from doing his job by the comment, "This is a scientific expedition."? Sad to see such potential lost, in spite of some wondrous moments and scenery.</p>

A better movie would be Part 1 and Part 2 condensed and rewritten.<br/><br/>Interesting for Alien fans (as I am) as we learn more about the Alien species that I presume will  be fleshed out in more detail in the next instalment. <br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[1]]<br/>Oh please. Ridley Scott should go a skulk into the corner in shame. Under developed characters that you don't give a damn about (1D characters in 3D). An incoherent screenplay.  A total lack of suspense...which was of course the key ingredient of at least the first two Alien movies. At least the self-surgery was so implausible I got a good laugh for 30 seconds. So disappointing. Perhaps the most disappointing movie I've seen in a while.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[8]]<br/>I love sci-fi and very much enjoyed this movie (3D was OK).  The 2 hours flew by, lean and tight, with excellent acting all round.  I wonder if some of character development and the links that many thought were missing, ended up on the cutting room floor? I would have been happy with another 30 minutes (like Avatar).  Perhaps there will be an extended version for DVD.  It left many questions unanswered - can't wait for the sequel, or is it a another prequel?</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[4]]<br/>Mumbo jumbo half-baked  Erich von Daniken claptrap full of underwritten/redundant characters (Charlize Theron has no purpose  other than as "indoors scenery") that cannibalises &amp; debauches the Alien mythology in a manner reminiscent of the Star Wars prequels.  Their "explanations" are invariably disappointing (people have been thinking about the Alien universe for 30 years). Yes, it looks great - but these days all these films look great, but that's half art-design, half software.  CGI ennui anyone?<br/><br/>I could go on. Pretend it's not related to Alien and it's a mildly amusing if cumbersome and periodically dull SF romp.<br/><br/>Fassbender, however, is genius.</p>

The music was just terrible, with all the references to 2001, I really think Ridley Scott could have done quite well by using something by Ligeti or perhaps even Tavener.  Their music would relate with the grand themes of the film so much better.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[6]]<br/>Unfortunately a boring movie<br/><br/>Lacklustre development of suspense, fear, and narrative drive  ... The timing of the editing leaves so much space, that we are well prepared and know what is going to happen<br/><br/>The geologist character is unnecessarily annoying, therefore we fail to care what happens to him<br/><br/>Visually it is quite beautiful <br/><br/>I loved the acting of the central female actor and Charlize Theron<br/><br/>Unless you are still familiar with other Aliens movies you may wonder why the android does what he does<br/><br/>Make up on Guy Pearce is too much (too caked on) &amp;not convincing of a 100 year old man<br/><br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[10]]<br/>While some inattentive folk complained about the screenplay, my mind was transported to another world for 2 hours with my senses on fire.  Wow, what a future to embrace in less than 80 years.  We'll be able to travel 327 trillion km in 2.4 years and visit a star cluster which strongly resembles the actual configuration, distance, and folklore of the Pleiades.  The journey of the Prometheus calculates to more than 14 times light speed, and at trek's end we get to squish some nasty aliens, all while learning something of our place in the universe.  I'm pumped.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[5]]<br/>There are many problems with Prometheus. The characters are not developed, their motivations largely unknown, their choices are often poor/outright stupid. Noomi looked confused, we never really knew her boyfriend and what was android David up to? The ability to sprint immediately after major abdominal surgery was jarring. The addition to the Alien mythos is equally confusing. <br/><br/>Having said that, it is enjoyable - some beautiful landscapes at the start and a striking opening scene. There are some iconic scenes. It is a soup of a plot, but a pretty enjoyable soup. <br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[9]]<br/>I've seen this twice now and loved it the second time more than the first. I'm a huge fan of the original Alien films (but not the Alien-predator rubbish) and was excited about the release of this film. I loved the sets, the special effects and the big themes it explores, who are we? etc.  Look, there are plenty of holes in the story and yes Alien was better but I just sat back and enjoyed the ride trying not to over think it. This is the first of 3 films of a series.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[7]]<br/>This film is a bit uninspiring, but is worth seeing just for the photography. It has sort of revived the franchise for me, after what FOX did to it with the Alien 3, Alien Resurrection and Alien vs Predator garbage. <br/>Fassbender is great, but an android hated by a crew of low-lifes, who gets dismembered, but goes on talking, is something we have seen before so many times. Amazing how the perfectly life-like flesh always suddenly looks like plastic when it's severed.<br/>Loved the scene where the surgery machine refuses to work until Noomi fiddles with it. That was pretty suspenseful.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[4]]<br/>The cardboard characters and ho-hum screenplay added up to me having zero stake in the goings on in Prometheus.  Sure, it looked great and had some grand ideas but this was not nearly enough to save this movie.  It's quite ironic that a film about the origins of humanity and our search for meaning could portray people in such a shallow way.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[3]]<br/>To be considered serious Sci fi (it's not a horror flick like Alien) it needed some credibility in the script and characters. It had neither. <br/>Examples (spoilers) for those who want to review...<br/>- who drew the primitive cave pictures? Not the alien who seeded, surely. Who else would have known about them? And anyway, why a starmap to a military installation!!!<br/>- at the start  either the world was seeded with progenitor DNA returned to the basic building blocks or human DNA was seeded. With any understanding of evolution, how could it return an identical species developed from another planet? <br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[1]]<br/>Fantastic imagery for sci-fi fans but what a cr@p story.  How lame - there was no sense of horror or foreboding.  Nothing made sense.  Ripley Scott took half a dozen scenes from Alien and made a pathetic dumbed down homage, especially the final creature scene.  And he recycled many of Ron Cobb's unused concept renderings created for the original Alien movie.  I felt ripped off.   I didn't believe the poor reviews but I was wrong. This movie was a collection of frothy lightweight scenes which barely connected.  Just as well I went on a free ticket.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[4]]<br/>Being a large fan of the original Alien movie, i found this movie to be a massive let-down. The screenplay was poor and the general story-line lacked the action and suspense to keep a science fiction lover begging for more. The ambiguous ending did make me ponder on how Ridley would construct his sequal and i did enjoy the very few scenes of action. One thing that did stand out throughout the entire movie were the fantastic visuals. If you are interested in seeing it, do it in 3D!</p>

I agree with others below, no tension, no suspense, no surprises. Great visuals alone cannot sustain my interest for every one of the 124 loooongg minutes this took to unfold.

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[5]]<br/>I think the film had an interesting premise, but it was dealt with in a way that was quite silly and cliched. Lots of people were laughing in places where it was probably not meant to be funny. In addition, not only were the humans one-dimensional, but the "aliens" were too.  I was hoping they would be more well rounded, and not just slimy, freakish, aggressive creatures.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[8]]<br/>Prometheus was never meant to be a Alien prequel. Ridley Scott made that clear in all the pre movie press(although i tried to avoid all the hype and even ignore the trailers).<br/>As a previous reviewer said-the spectacle alone was worth the admission price. For two hours i was transported to a dangerous spectacular far away place. The 3D was subtle and not distracting at all.

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[4]]<br/>Epic fail. Two stars because it looks great. As a screenwriter and sci-fi fanatic I couldn't really imagine anything more torturous than sitting through two hours of this. Ridley what the hell were you thinking? The film may have been 3D but the characters certainly weren't. I had low expectations for the screenplay but I really didn't expect it to be that bad. There was no suspense, no thrills, just two painful hours of nice shots....yawn.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[8]]<br/>I enjoyed it! Held my attention! Been missing Sci Fi movies.....need more!  I think the script could have been tighter though...should have fleshed out Charlize's character better and her relationship with Weyland.  Think that could have been really played up more. The characters could have been stronger and agree it is in the writing.  I did love the visuals though....need more spaceships, aliens and travel to distant planets!  Thanks Ridley for doing a sci fi movie...please do more!</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[9]]<br/>Prometheus certainly has some glaring inconsistencies. And it's relationship to the existing Alien franchise means it is under a glaring spotlight. Yet wih its stunning visuals (the best since Avatar) it is ultimately what every good sci-fi flick should be -  pure escapist adventure! Bring on Prometheus 2!</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[5]]<br/>The ultimate example of the decline of good storytelling. Laughable screenplay. For serious sci-fi (as opposed to cheesy sci-fi), this is just plain bad. Disappointing to the max. Plotholes galore. An ordinary sci-fi that doesn't come close to any of the original  four 'Alien' films. The turd I foresaw based on the synopsis</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[5]]<br/>Very average indeed.   Of course the effects were amazing but as we all know thats never enough to qualify as a good film. Dumbed down just like avatar.<br/>All the characters were 1 dimensional stereotypes and Charlize Theron's character was utterly annoying.<br/>The religious overtones were nauseating. <br/>I knew it would disappoint but I went to see it for the spectacle it is anyway.  <br/>When are they going to create a film with great effects, a great story, great characters and and a great script all in one?   Hasn't happened yet. This movie has ruined alien.</p>

It's not Alien either. <br/><br/>After watching this, I felt pretty satisfied with it. It made me go home and revisit the old Alien films. And I gotta say, it's better than all the Alien related films from Alien 3 onward.  <br/><br/>A true prequel? Maybe, maybe not. Open-ended? Sure. But hell, I'm a sucker for open-endedness.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[10]]<br/>I really don't understand the negativity regarding this movie. It was a masterpiece. A brilliant prequel to Alien, setting up the situation for the Alien movie brilliantly, and expanding the concept in a really interesting direction. As far as the script is concerned - Look, the script in a film like this exists to move the plot along - that's what this script does. It aint meant to be Shakespeare. As for the other aspects of the film, I was staggered. A great epic sci-fi film that blows away everything else I've seen in recent times. Bravo Ridley Scott!!!</p>

Fassbender is excellent!<br/>Otherwise this film is a major disappointment - silly music score, rediculous and nonsensical story, terrible characterization (I did not care what happened to any of the characters) and the biggest crime of all in a sci-fi horror, no suspense.

As a prequel its half baked and doesnt make a lot of sense, and as a sci fi its garbage.  A good sci fi has a good, well  thought out story, this has a jumble of random ideas stitched together with some very vague threads and stupid cliches, no depth or originality what so ever.

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[7]]<br/>I think comparing it to Alien is a mistake, because in some ways it is a better film. Not as scary but a bit more cerebral, more philosophical. The science is a bit wonky because, if DNA did come from somewhere else it would have come in spores or meteorites very early in evolution. Another plot hole (spoiler here) is how did the monster grow without feeding on anything?<br/><br/>It's a 'creation myth' and should be seen through that lens. I'm looking forward to the next one. I thought android the best character, but Noomi was a gutsy believable heroine.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[5]]<br/>Problem, stupid Eric Von Danken storyline. Original ALIEN, hellishly unfamiliar - seminal film capturing nightmarish alien world, unlike anything seen, a malevolent successor to seminal 2001. This ruinous Alien prequel  perpetuates stupid 'crowd pleaser  Alien vs Preditor sullying original conceptions of Alien &amp; 2. Should have explored  the Space Jockey  its wraithlike, bioengineered craft. Needed to take cue from  otherworld, unconceivable  millions light years away, discovering Alien territory - with no pre history that  involved human progenitors or such lazy synopsis. Prequel needed to follow  Alien concept, what may lurk in the void, a journey to interstellar, cosmic hell.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[2]]<br/>I never felt more dissapointed after waiting for so long to see this movie.  Visual effects great, especially in 3D. Story plot full of holes. Why would the engineers leave markings on Earth so many years ago, only to point us to a planet to bring about our own destruction? What was the point of the other "dormant" engineer space ships sitting burried next to this one?  To me it was just a rushed movie that promises to answer a lot of questions in the sequel!

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[2]]<br/>Very poor script... Let's throw every cliched American military type on the crew... NONE of these people would ever be charged with crewing a Trillion dollar expedition on a spectacular ship such as Prometheus. Idiots who travel two years to find an amazing discovery who act like fools upon arrival... There was practically no suspense, entirely predictable plot and the worst ending possible. Yes the visuals are incredible, but if they gave anyone the money and the technology to do it, they could do it.. But Ridley Scott should be embarrassed with this effort, but the script was lazy.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[4]]<br/>So disappointed in this really was b-grade. So cliched and predictable it was as if Michael Bay directed it. Who signed off on this script? Utter mess. Visually amazing. What really deserves praise is whoever did the marketing on this film. Trailers were exceptional - hats off to them getting so many of us excited to go watch the film but them come out feeling so deflated and let down. The very last scene in the movie, there was a big groan from the whole cinema audience. If Scott is happy with this pleeaasse don't touch Blade Runner.</p>

Two thins to say about the film its good but not great and that abdominal surgery was absolutely vile.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[8]]<br/>Perhaps the direction of the story focusing on the origin of mankind as well as some finer details about the characters on board Prometheus has me a little lost, but there was never a chance the mystery and the tension so well created would let go of the stranglehold it casts. There are several impressive elements to Prometheus. The build up of the story being one. Each of the characters along for the exploration are interesting in their separate ways. The visuals are majestically designed while the creature effects and each attack scene are also really effective. Impressive!</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[6]]<br/>I think I gave it 3 stars only coz I wanted it to be 5 and felt seriously let down. On the plus side, design &amp; visuals were magnificent; on the minus most characters totally sucked. Not for a second was it believable that this mob were the cream of the crop selected as ambassadors of humanity. The shit-scared dude who befriended an alien snake - cum-on! and Guy Pierce's old-man makeup - laughable. Cheron's ice-maiden - shithouse. Come on Ridley, the strongly implied sequel needs to be better than this &amp; live up to the promise of this let-down.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[5]]<br/>Boring and overly intellectual. here was I expecting Alien nasties, and what do I get, a slick space craft, which considering that it is supposed to predate the Nostromo, was already a problem for me. A stupid plot centered around Eric Von Daniken theories, and then when you think the alien nasties are about to turn up, well, disapointment! Here was I expecting big nasty insectoid rapacious aliens. As for the heroine, please! Ripley left big shoes to fill, she is the archetype female action hero, Liz Shaw is no Ripley! Altogether it was disappointing. Good sci-fi bad Alien film.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[5]]<br/>There's a line where Elizabeth Shaw says to David the android: "you have no soul." For me this sums up the entire movie. It's a copy of Alien, and not a good one. The style is great, there are good performances, but in the end it delivers nothing new. I knew all the plot points in advance. <br/><br/>I wanted to find out about the Space Jockeys. Why did they make all those weapons? How did the aliens turn the tables on them? This to me, was the story that should have been told first. Far more interesting than Alien Redux.</p>

Even the nerds who rave here are saying the film's screenplay is total rubbish. How to the count the ways it lets us down? Such a confused and unbelievable storyline, no characterisation, unbelievable motives ... the only good character is the robot - but even he is inconsistent and unclear ... and as for Guy Pearse ... Paul Byrne was right: a dying Howard Hughes crossed w a turtle) and what's he doing there, anyway? ... God, I'm so mad about this I can barely write!</p>

The 3D effects were great however and the sett was excellent. Fun but unfulfilling.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[7]]<br/>The weight of expectation was always going to topple this film, considering Scott is about 30 years out from his best work. However, I wouldn't point the finger squarely at his direction.<br/><br/>Somewhere inside Prometheus there is the film that everyone hoped for. Amazingly tense and iconic sequences hint towards something that could have been. The film ultimately fails because of its scope. When you ask bigger questions you are forced to give bigger answers. The immense plot holes and incoherent narrative undermine the films potential, making the action merely incidental to the films climax. Scott should ask smaller questions.<br/><br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[4]]<br/>Woeful storyline; 3D was wasted on this trash. Special effects (2 stars) were good. Depressing to see an interesting premise perverted into a violence-fest. Wondered what this could have been if it had speculated on a more positive interaction with aliens/our forbears. Relentless inability to see anything other than aggressive and deadly outcomes made this a tedious waste of money. p.s. If I staffed a mission like I would not be selecting people with defective personalities (Fifeld the geologist), rather choosing people likely to succeed not make predictably immature decisions, eg follow basic guidelines like "don't touch the wildlife".<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[9]]<br/>Prometheus is epic, visually stunning, horrific and a great addition to alien. The ideas in this movie are so huge and the amount of digging you have to do to realise them is so worth it, because there is just so much to look at. I think the caesarean scene will go down in history as, much like the chestburster scene in 1979, one of the most horrific scenes in history. I think people are missing alot of the movie, its depth, characters and ideas, and need to see it, and the whole series, again to understand.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[6]]<br/>A crew that is half imbeciles, and half not so 'scientific/intelligent', somehow were chosen/picked for a Trillions dollar mission. Alcohol on a serious space mission? Very little character development for most of them and thus you get almost no link formed to anyone. Apart from maybe David (the android), who was probbly the only star of the whole movie. A hodge podge script, with too many laughable/ridiculous occurences, greatly detracted from the amazing visuals and technologies. It could have been so much more! Still worth seeing, but it was far removed from Alien's "all aspects" quality.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[9]]<br/>It has no central character nor has a hero being developed,( one person saved the world) but it has showned group efforts and courage, some of the crew's  behaviors  were similar to the original Alien's crews, poorly selected for the manning of the space ship. The chilling message  remained the same ,that privatizing of space exploration by business enterprise may not be good for human.  A sequel is a must. Perhap the adventure of  Shaw, independent  of Ripley.</p>

Poor acting, an aimless disconnected plot and no bloody Geiger aliens, then may I reccomend the crushing disappointment which is Prometheus.<br/>It makes the film 2012 look coherent, credible and entertaining.<br/>Michael Fassbender was ok though.</p>

Sure the set design etc is great,  Visually stunning, good effects...  what about the storyline?<br/>We've a great cast, but some really dumb moments, and dialogue.  Rapace is a great actress wasted.<br/>I really thought they were going to actually marry up the final scenes in Prometheus to Alien...  but no...  instead we get a kick in the teeth, a big disappointment, because the Director and the Screenwriters did not respect the original story or their audience.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[2]]<br/>This film should've been called ICARUS because it reaches too high and ends up crashing and burning. Far too many ideas, narrative strands and superfluous characters and the dialogue is inept at best. This concept could've worked in the hands of a more experienced writer but Lindelof and Spaihts aren't up to the task. Disappointing in the extreme - lets hope the sequel gets a far better treatment.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[6]]<br/>Viewing this movie as its own and not a comparison to Alien, then yes it's a decent watch and worth checking out on the big screen.<br/><br/>As mentioned by Margaret and David, it is visually stunning but its biggest downfall is the screenplay (lack of character development). I personally didn't feel connected to any of the characters and therefore didn't really engage and care what happened to them. So many of their actions seemed to be cliche' and at time unbelievable. <br/><br/>However the ideas behind their exploration and visual cinematography was enough for me to stay engaged. Three Stars.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[8]]<br/>I don't think neither David nor Margaret understood what the film was about. It is not a horror/slasher film that was Alien. It uses very similar set up to explore something else, our origins. So, it is, in fact, a pure science fiction. I do agree, however, the writing was bad, the film overall was grand. No sci-fi film like it recently.</p>

However, the concept of an even more hostile version of the human race, establishing hyper-advanced biological warfare testing sites... was not expected, at least by myself, and I truly do appreciate the ideas involved in this awesome sci-fi flick. <br/>It cannot be easy to create original sci-fi these days, however this movie really goes there...

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[8]]<br/>I really enjoyed this movie, I loved Alien, and the way Prometheus left so many biological and inter(galactical) evolutionary questions so unanswered. And yet, Prometheus really sets us up for a possibility which is so unexpected, and yet so utterley believable... The questioning of faith is almost unnecessary, a movie like this takes on such a weight of thought and belief, it must bind up almost every believer inside.<br/>On a technical note, its a shock to see the aesthetic contrast between this movie and it's supposed future self (Alien), unavoidable unfortunately, considering different budgets and technology.<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[8]]<br/>Well I was an early Alien fan, and after reading the poor reviews I didnt expect too much, when taking my son to see it.  <br/><br/>But I walked out stunned. Its a TRIP, the cinamatography, the sci-fi underpinnings (especially computerised surgery by drop down screens).  Rather than comapring to Alien, it should be compared to Avatar. Avatar was at a simialr level of sci-fi, encompassing cinamatogrphy etc. (Addmittadly Avatar screen play somewhat better). Its not another Alien, but its a trip.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[1]]<br/>downright silly - expected so much from a much-hyped Ridley Scott film. Awfu script - unforgiveable really - dull characters you didn't care about apart from Edris - and Cherise surely was a robot. Just so muddled - what was in the phial David gave to the good doctor - why- and why was he so sinister - why did the 2 crew get "penetrated" by the slimy things - no connections here!!! I guess we saw the birth of an "alien" at the end but by then - who cared anyway. So so disappointing. Just lazy!!</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[4]]<br/>Really disappointing. I was always worried when Lindloff's name became associated with this project. Even the ice candy couldn't carry the inept and uninspired script. Ridley Scott tried too hard for the grandoise and ended up with a rather contrived and ultimately uneventful dud.  There was little tension or shock value and the characters were so cliche, uncharismatic and boring it's hard to believe they didn't kill themselves before the alien(s) got to them. Prometheus is a poor film. Hopefully Scott ditches the hacks that put this script together and moves on to something new, perishing thoughts of a Pt.2</p>

Ridleys gone all Lucas on us unfortunately. I just pray that he does'nt go ahead with the "Blade Runner" sequel. Now im scared .<br/>I do recommend you go see it though if only for Michael Fassbenders performance alone.<br/>James Cameron will probably make a sequel now called "Promethius's" lol</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[8]]<br/>One movie where you really feel like you get your money's worth.  Visually amazing and so entertaining.  The Alien formula is there with the virtuous mission and the bad guys with their own agenda.  But more depth to story than the original.  Granted the screenplay not great and Charlize Theron was a weird choice with all other actors much more edgy.  The Android stole the show...again.  Great movie with great discussion potential for after.  Winner!</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[9]]<br/>Make no mistake, even in the classic "Alien" there are some truly naff moments (witness: "Ash is robot! Ash is a god damn robot!!"). Nothing is perfect.<br/><br/>Yet with Prometheus, Ridley has achieved something I thought impossible: charted a new and credible course for an utterly worn-out franchise, this time taking us into more thoughtful sci-fi territory. It's epic in scope, yet doesn't forego the suspense of lone castaways in space fighting to survive against highly advanced foes.<br/><br/>Margaret, you gave Resident Evil Afterlife 3.5 stars, and Prometheus 3 stars. By any measure on Earth, one of those scores is wrong.</p>

The sudden jumps &amp; lack of any clear continuity became more irritating as this mess went on. Ridley Scott must have seen the daily rushes &amp; seen what a dogs breakfast he had on his hands,I hold him responsible! The last shot of the movie was the final slap in the face!

Whilst visually stunning the chracters were not as engaging as Alien.<br/><br/>Also, I didn't think that we needed to wait as long as we did for the connection to the other Alien movies.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[5]]<br/>I haven't been this disappointed in a movie since the first Star Wars prequel.  Looks amazing and has its moments, but it never really comes together as a whole. Weak characterisation, dialogue and pacing let it down.<br/><br/>I don't know why they ever let Damon Lindelof near this movie. He is an awful writer and this movie reinforced his weaknesses in writing realistic character motivations and dialogue that had been apparent in Lost from the beginning.<br/><br/>Temper your expectations.</p>

Her scientist husband is unbelievable, imagine travelling 2 years in stasis only to bungle around the discovery of a lifetime for a mere 4 hours upon landing, and determine that the whole trip was a waste because the engineers are all dead and then sulk in a bottle. even if his presence and demise was only to bring about a new race of Alien, John Hurt's character Kane accomplished a lot more in the original Alien just lying on slab with a facehugger attached to his face.</p>

The weakish script acted like the domino effect and hit the acting, but i thought the acting was very well done for its genre. The CGI and cinematography is oscar worthy meaning OUTSTANDING.<br/>Too many reviews i see are comparing this film to alien and rating low, but the film by itself as a sci-fi...i came out of cinema stunned at how epic it was, Ridley did a great job, screenplay...not so much, overall great sci-fi.</p>

I hate that pure nostalgia and Ridley Scott's patented visual effects that give a nod to his great Alien franchise will invoke so many people to pretend that this was a good movie! Take away the glitz, glamour, and HYPE and this is a B movie barely deserving to appear on the Sci-fi channel. It featured a snake that turns a man into a zombie.... an egg that turns a guy into an engineer who impregnates a girl with a squid.  B movie.

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[9]]<br/>This is a good well thought out prequel . ..   The film unlike many in the genre recently attempts to be imaginative  and make the grey matter think out of the box  . We are asked to cogitate about the ultimate sense of existence .  Of course we are never going to get another Sigourney Weaver specifically made for these sort of roles but Repace , Fassbender and Theron come up with a credible effort. I thought the rest of the cast did not offer as much compared to Alien Resurrection.  Idris Elba effort was particularly inexpressive</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[9]]<br/>The original Alien films are, in order, structured as a horror film, war movie, cowboy film and jail movie (let's pretend Alien v. Predator were never made). This one was different as it is much more a traditional sci-fi film, a lot like Forbidden Planet in some ways. There are supposed to be 2 more in the series so hopefully a lot of the interesting questions will be answered. I deliberately saw this in 2D and loved the visuals. I find 3D too distracting but others may disagree.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[7]]<br/>Expected kick-ass from Noomi and got disappointed, fassbender was the bestest reminded me of Data in Star Trek,  but the most oustanding was the visual effects, saw it in 2D extremescreen, but I think it needs 3D to appreciate even more, there are some scenes that didnt link up, the musical score was disappointiong too, but all that said, better than alot of blockbuster movies of late, as Noomi reported most of the scenes/sets were genuine no cgi/green screen.<br/><br/>PS:  Sorry Noomi you carnt act british with a a swedish accent</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[7]]<br/>this films was fantastic in it's visuals, it's concepts and it's acting. HOWEVER The screenplay unfortunately dropped the ball on this one, the pace felt uneven. The film became confused with its goals, and characters unfortunately fell into classic horror tropes -which i thought was disappointing. Prometheus is at it's best when no one is talking and you just let this dreary lost world breathe and watch the characters characters escape peril, when they talk...not so much</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[9]]<br/>I throughly enjoyed this film from start to finish including the interesting twist at the end. I found the plot and character development quite satisfactory and look forward to the next instalment?? I found the 3D more subtle and realistic than for example "Avatar". I think your ratings, Margaret and David, were a bit harsh, especially considering the almost equal ranking you gave "Friends with kids"</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[4]]<br/>I agree with Margaret but it, disappointingly, does not really explain the unexplained bits in the original 'Alien'.  Especially, the scene of the 'space jockey' which was so tantalising in the original.  The characters were much better drawn in the original as well.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[7]]<br/>This movie had promise, and visually it looks amazing. I haven't seen the Alien films and so thought this would be a good intro to it. I thought Scott's direction was good, and Fassbender, Rapace and Elba were good. But the script was poor; it never gave you the chance to fully 'get' the characters, instead falling back on cliched caricatures. If you like gooey, crunching, and at times quite predictably-gory violence, then this film will be for you. Its a good film, but not the great film it should be and certainly not worth the hype its got.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[7]]<br/>Looks great, great direction and cinematography and impeccable effects. But story is a little text book and wafer thin. Interesting underdeveloped characters don't get the interest they should to really give the story bulk. But Scott is still truly the master of the genre he created</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[9]]<br/>Had the same opinions after seeing it for the first time as your review. Visually stunning but left with lots of questions. Intrigued enough for a second viewing. Now I rate it much higher. A fantastic sci-fi film that sets a new bench mark technically for what a 3d stereo film should be. Cinematography 5 stars. Vfx 5 stars. Screenplay 3. Acting 3. Design and direction 4 stars</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[7]]<br/>Not that Prometheus is 100% an "Alien" film, but if it was, I'd rate it third behind Alien and Aliens.<br/><br/>That might not sound very encouraging to those hoping for more but being third behind Alien and Aliens is nothing to be ashamed about as this film still towers miles above Alien3, Alien Resurrection and the god awful AvP films (not to mention most of the other Hollywood blockbusters that this will be competing against at the box office).<br/></p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[7]]<br/>Yep saw it on the world's biggest screen and was glad I did. It's sure nice to see big old-fashioned straight sci-fi again.<br/><br/>I agree with David&amp;Margaret. And in a certain way this film is very similar to Alien in structure. Looks amazing, but could have used another draft for characterisation. Only a few characters get love, and the biggest sin is one is completely redundant - story would have been exactly the same without them. Won't say but you'll figure it out quickly.<br/><br/>It's not a film that's fairly good throughout, it's a film with great and ordinary moments too.</p>

<p class="comment">((Prometheus))[[6]]<br/>I was entertained by the film, especially its incredible visual style.  The use of real-life barren locations really helped evoke an otherworldly-ness.<br/>For negatives, I found the story, characters , dialogue too 'obvious', <br/>I also questioned the scientific credentials of the mission - helmets too-readily removed, poor quarantine and a geologist character without geology commentary at all.<br/>I found the film's "ancient astronaut" concept pretty weak - humanity shares much of its DNA with Earth's other lifeforms - any "ancient astronaut" would be much more likely to "seed" Earth with simple microbial life which later evolved rather than putting humans there.</p>
